<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This volume is an amplified and expanded
essay read before the members of the Young
Men's Society in connection with Park Church,
Highbury, on the evening of the 2nd of November,
1874. The original purpose of the
author was to indicate to the associates of
that Christian institution how the influence of
German anti-Christian literature, made plain to
English readers by such books as the one under
review, might be withstood and neutralised, and
to supply an antidote to the poisonous insinuations
respecting Christianity which many of the
periodicals of the day disseminate in noticing
works of this character. Those that are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
professedly hostile to religion have a way of
treating Truth and Error as if nothing had
been proved, and as if the question were quite
an open one whether Divine Revelation is, or
is not, a reality. The present design of the
author has a wider range than he first intended.
He desires to induce, not only young men, but
those nearer his own age, and placed, much as
himself, in the great centres of business, who
have not much time for research into such
matters, to bring their intelligence fairly alongside
the bold pretensions of the cavillers and
quibblers who presume to <i>know</i> that there is
no God, or that He has not spoken. He desires
to remind those who are doubting that "there
is a knowledge that creates doubts which
nothing but a larger knowledge can satisfy," and
that he who stops in the difficulty "will be
perplexed and uncomfortable for life." Having
investigated for himself, the author indicates the
result, and would like, if he can, to facilitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
the inquiry which it is, unquestionably, the duty
and interest of every one to make. If to rest
on a foregone conclusion on a matter of such
momentous importance is not altogether justifiable
on the Christian side of the question, how
much less so on the other! For it should be
remembered that, on the one side, looking at
the question from a <i>primâ facie</i> point of view,
we have a faith which has the endorsement of
the highest civilisation, the best morality, the
truest culture, the noblest aspirations, and the
greatest happiness which humanity has ever
experienced; in contrast with a negation which
has nothing to offer as a substitute, taking away
the light that illumines the path of life, and
leaving it in utter darkness.</p>

<p>As to the book under review, the anonymous
author seems to regard the evidences of Supernatural
Religion as a region of swamp or sand,
in which solid rock is nowhere to be found upon
which faith may obtain a firm footing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
takes us in his survey here and there, and says
that what seems to be solid stone is only slightly
congealed sand, which, at the touch of his
criticism, dissolves and falls away. We fix our
attention on one of these masses, and the result
is, that it is not what he alleges, but, verily,
granite. If the reader who is not prejudiced
against Christianity will attentively peruse this
volume to the end, he will probably incline to
this opinion. If any whose views in regard to
Christianity are hostile should be at the trouble
to read it, it is the hope of the author that the
result will be to stimulate inquiry and research,
for "that which is true in religion cannot be
shaken, and that which is false, no one can
desire to preserve." In so far as the writer of
"Supernatural Religion" and others have, by
their reference to early Patristic literature,
shown how certain it is that Jesus lived and
taught, they have done service to the cause of
Christianity; for the writings, the traditions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
the history of the Church are too closely identified
with the Sermon on the Mount to admit of the
probability that He who could thus teach was
less than "He believed Himself to be." On such
a foundation the superstructure is so appropriate,
that the "possibility" which John Stuart Mill
conceived is near to <i>probability</i>, and <i>probability</i> to
a <i>full assurance of faith</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Nothing in these days is taken for granted. In
science, philosophy, politics, and religion, the
foundations of belief are fearlessly examined, and
the facilities for the process are unprecedented.
Criticism has new and improved instruments,
and they are extensively used&mdash;often misused.
It concerns us especially to know how far our
religious institutions are being affected.</p>

<p>Have devout men, during the three thousand
years which history chronicles, been under a
delusion in believing that "there is a spirit in
man, and the Almighty giveth him understanding"?</p>

<p>Is popular Christianity "wide of the truth,
and a disfigurement of the truth," as an eminent
writer the other day asserted? Such questions
float in our literature and find their way into our
homes and our sanctuaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Although no importance is to be attached to
the reckless assertion that the outworks of Evangelical
Religion are in danger, and that the very
citadel itself is not impregnable, it is undoubtedly
true that its modern adversaries&mdash;reputable and
otherwise&mdash;are bold, active, and skilful, and there
is need that its defenders should be alert and
vigilant. It will not do to rely altogether on the
defensive lines and tactics of our predecessors.
Each generation has the stronghold entrusted to
its care, and new appliances are, from time to
time, required to resist novel as well as resuscitated
modes of assault.</p>

<p>However certain be the ultimate triumph of
His cause whose right it is to reign, the rate of
its progress depends upon the faithfulness and
heroism of His servants at their various posts of
labour and conflict.</p>

<p>To change the figure. The mirror which reflects
Divine truth has to be preserved and kept
bright by human instrumentality. Superstition,
in the murky atmosphere of sacerdotalism, clouds
it; by false philosophy it is liable to be dimmed;
while crude science or unsound criticism, removing
the silver lining to make the glass more
transparent, makes it useless. He does well who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
is able to act as its conservator, and in some
measure cleanse the surface, that obscurity may
be removed and eternal truth discerned.</p>

<p>I am aware that, as a rule, it is not desirable
that hostile literature should be helped into notoriety,
and that believers should be troubled with
exploded fallacies and disturbed by arguments
against the truth as it is in Jesus a hundred times
answered.</p>

<p>As Robert Hall justly remarks:&mdash;"It is degrading
to the dignity of a revelation, established
through a succession of ages by indubitable
proofs, to be adverting every moment to
the hypothesis of its being an imposture, and to
be inviting every ignorant sophist to wrangle
about the title, when we should be cultivating
the possession."</p>

<p>But there are exceptions to every rule, and as
I am not addressing a promiscuous audience, but
the members of a society whose rule is to discuss
all subjects without limitation, I venture to think
I am justified in bringing under your notice a
recent heterodox book which is so well written as
to be likely to mislead if it be not neutralized.
And the more so, if I can make the author not
only answer himself, but other writers whose anti-Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
arguments are not put forth anonymously,
but with the authority of well-known
names and much reputation in the world of letters
and science.</p>

<p>Let me further premise that the Christian is
occupying an exceptional position when he descends
to the neutral level of the sceptic to discuss
the internal evidences of Evangelical truth. His
usual privileged abode is more favourable for the
survey than the lower ground, for the light is
brighter and the air clearer on the mountain
heights where he is wont to contemplate religious
matters, than on the plain where faith has no
temple, and reason, ignoring Divine influence,
operates with the carnal instruments of a
negative creed. To appeal to the spiritual
discernment of a disbeliever in Divine illumination
would be like expecting a man who
is not of the mystical craft of the Masonic
brotherhood to use the signs (if such there be) of
a Freemason. Yet the argument in defence of
the reality of Divine revelation is not complete
without a reference to that "Spirit of Truth"
which Jesus Christ promised to send "to testify
of him," and to "bring all things to the remembrance"
of those disciples who were to "bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
witness, because they had been with him from
the beginning."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A good cause may be injured by injudicious and
feeble advocacy, but I trust I am not presumptuously
meddling with a theme which only an
erudite scholar and theologian should deal with.
I beg you to bear in mind, however, that if I or
others fail in the contest for truth, there still will
remain the indubitable proofs of Divine revelation
in all their variety and superabundance.</p>

<p>Although the ability, scholarship, and research
displayed in this anti-Christian work are considerable,
I doubt if it has really much in it that is
original. The author has only cleverly reproduced
and rearranged the anti-Christian arguments,
chiefly German,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which are to be found in the
library of the British Museum.</p>

<p>The "Examiner" says, in regard to three-fourths
of the work, "It is neither more nor less
than a digest of recent German speculation on
the date and authorship of the Gospels; devoid
of originality, and infected with the verbosity and
repetition of the authorities on which it is based."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>In the other notices of the work which have
appeared so far, it has, I think, been somewhat
over-estimated.</p>

<p>The "Fortnightly Review" writes of it: "It
is not too much to say of the two volumes before
us that they are by far the most decisive, trenchant,
and far-reaching of the direct contributions
to theological controversy that have been made
in this generation."</p>

<p>The "Athenæum" says: "The book proceeds
from a man of ability, a scholar, and reasoner,
who writes like an earnest seeker after truth, and
knows well all the German and Dutch books
relating to the criticism of the New Testament,
as well as the English ones."</p>

<p>The "Westminster Review" asserts that "no
more formidable assailant of orthodoxy could well
be imagined."</p>

<p>The "Spectator" designates it a "masterly
but prejudiced examination of the evidences for
the antiquity of the Christian Scriptures."</p>

<p>"The Literary World" says: "This is, beyond
all question, an important book. The one
grand pervading fault we find with it is its
partisanship. The writer plays the part of special
pleader against what he calls Ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Christianity, and fails to represent what could
be said on the other side. It is a partisan production,
a piece of clever, ingenious, plausible,
special pleading. The author has got up his
case with marvellous exclusiveness. He makes
it an absolute rule, so far as we perceive, to
regard his opponents as having no case at all."</p>

<p>The quarterly reviews, "Edinburgh," "Quarterly,"
and "British Quarterly," have not yet
pronounced an opinion on its merits.</p>

<p>My purpose is to show that the author of this
anonymous work has not been successful in accomplishing
the two things he has attempted,
viz., to prove the <i>in</i>credibility of miracles by&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, a recast of the often-exploded syllogistic
fallacies of Hume; and, <i>secondly</i>, by an elimination
of the miraculous from the Gospels; but that
he has been successful, without intending it, in
showing that Supernatural Religion rests upon
substantial contemporary evidence.</p>

<p>The work consists of three parts. The first is
upon miracles, treating the subject as an abstract
question. The second, upon the Synoptic Gospels
(Matthew, Mark, and Luke). The third, upon
the Fourth Gospel. And there is a summary of
the supposed results of the reasoning and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
investigation. The inference arrived at is premature,
for as the New Testament does not
consist only of the four Gospels, but contains
other writings of equal importance, the argument
is incomplete, and the latter will have to be dealt
with before our author can reasonably expect any
reader to entertain his anti-miraculous hypothesis.
Another volume is promised, but we may safely
venture to anticipate that it will prove no more
formidable than the other great waves of scepticism
which have surged against, but have not
undermined, the rock upon which our faith is

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>In the first part of the work the following topics
are discussed by the author:&mdash;"Miracles in relation
to Christianity and the order of nature&mdash;Reason
in relation to the order of nature&mdash;The age
of miracles&mdash;The permanent stream of miraculous
pretension&mdash;Miracles in relation to ignorance and
superstition."</p>

<p>In stating the main purpose of his inquiry,
he says (p. 8):&mdash;"It is obvious that the reality
of miracles is the vital point in the investigation
which we have undertaken." "If the reality
of miracles cannot be established, Christianity
loses the only evidence by which its truth can be
sufficiently attested."</p>

<p>He might have dispensed with his arguments
against the views of those who endeavour to bring
the miracles of the Bible within the scope of the
laws of nature, and to modify them by explanatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
interpretations so as to satisfy the demands
of scientific and philosophical theologians.</p>

<p>Christianity admits of no such treatment. In
its essence it is superhuman, abnormal, phenomenal,
supernatural, though not unnatural. A
series of facts divinely attested, a proclamation of
mercy divinely commissioned, a system of means
divinely blessed, is the true definition of the gospel.</p>

<p>Discussing the antecedent credibility of miracles,
our author makes much of the references in the
Bible to the working of miracles by Satanic as well
as Divine agency. "If," says he, "miracles are
superhuman they are not super-Satanic." The
answer to this obviously is, that what was merely
a superstitious notion of the Jews, and that which
is taught by Divine authority, are two very different
things. Where in the Bible do we find
that God reveals His will by miracles which are
not the manifestations of His own power? Christ
points to the superhuman works that He was
doing in His Father's name as evidence of His
mission; and when the Jews suggested that He
cast out devils by Beelzebub, He said, "If Satan
cast out Satan he is divided against himself: how
shall his kingdom stand?"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The man born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
blind, to whom sight was given, said, "If this man
were not of God he could do nothing;"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and he
said it was "a marvellous thing" that the Jews
did not know <i>he</i> was from God who had wrought
the miracle.</p>

<p>"Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, said to
Jesus, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher
come from God: for no man can do these miracles
that thou doest except God be with him."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
"Some of the Pharisees said, This man is not of
God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.
Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do
such miracles?"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "Some of the Jews said, Can
a devil open the eyes of the blind?"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Our author's statement is certainly not supported
by the passage quoted from Deuteronomy
xiii. 3, of which he says, "The false miracle is
here attributed to God Himself." The words of
that passage are: "If there arise among you a
prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee
a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder
come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying,
Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
known, and let us serve them: thou shalt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth
you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God
with all your heart and with all your soul. Ye shall
walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and
keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and
ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. And
that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be
put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you
away from the Lord your God, which brought you
out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of
the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the
way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to
walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the
midst of thee." I transcribe the whole passage,
that its plain meaning may be seen, and you may
understand how much reliance is to be placed on
our author when he appears as a Bible commentator.
Of course the prophet referred to is one
"pretending to the Divine inspiration and authority
of the prophetic office," and "the dreamer
of dreams" one who pretends that some deity has
spoken to him in a dream.</p>

<p>If our author be a Biblical scholar, his scholarship
is greatly at fault in the passage he refers
to in Ezekiel xiv. 9: "And if the prophet be deceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
when he hath spoken a thing, I the Lord
have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out
my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the
midst of my people Israel." According to the
Hebrew language, God is often said to <i>do</i> a thing
which He only suffers or permits. How can God
be understood to harden Pharaoh's heart in any
other sense? The character of God is too plainly
described in the Bible to leave any uncertainty on
this point.</p>

<p>The passages quoted from the New Testament
only <i>apparently</i> support his statement. He quotes
Dr. Mansel in reference to them, and no doubt
his words truly apply where he says, "The supposed
miracles are not true miracles at all, <i>i.e.</i>,
are not the effects of Divine power, but of human
deception or some other agency." The existence
and powers of angels, good and bad, we know little
about, because little is revealed; but it is not the
Bible but superstition which teaches that the fallen
spirits have more power than the faithful ones in
the affairs of this world, that Satan is more potent
than Gabriel. If we knew more about the origin
of evil, this matter would probably be less mysterious
to our finite intelligence.</p>

<p>Our author describes (vol. i. page 47) what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
supposes orthodox Christianity includes; and
among other strange assertions he says that man
was tempted into sin by Satan, "an all-powerful
and persistent enemy of God," thus making the
fallen angel an <i>Almighty</i> being.</p>

<p>This matter has an important bearing on the
proper exhibition of religious truth, for the more
superstition is intermingled with it, the more will
unbelief be likely to be prevalent. On the one
hand, infidelity engenders superstition, and on the
other, superstition creates aversion to religion.
I cannot but think that there is something wrong
in the way in which Christian men, in the pulpit
and elsewhere, often allude to the spirit of evil.
He is represented in Scripture as the "god of
this world," but surely that is not to be understood
literally.</p>

<p>Jesus told the Jews that the devil was their
father, as their deeds being evil indicated, who
was "a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in
him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
As, therefore, the devil is the father of lies, so are
we to understand he is the God of this world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Not in any other sense. He is potent, but not
omnipotent; knowing, but not omniscient; has
his representatives distributed among the scenes
of sin and death in our world, and himself goeth
"to and fro in the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but he is not omnipresent.
It is Oriental demonology which teaches
that two equal principles&mdash;good and evil&mdash;are
alike dominant, not "the truth as it is in Jesus;"
Persian superstition, Gnostical heresy, not Divine
revelation.</p>

<p>The frivolous use of words and matters connected
with the spiritual world and our eternal
interests is greatly to be disapproved and condemned;
but surely the mention of Satan is not to
be designated as profane, as if God's holy name
were taken in vain. To comment on what are
called profane oaths in such a way is not to
enlighten the minds of the vulgar, but to mystify
and conceal the truth of Christianity. It is one
thing to believe that there is in existence the
spiritual being whose evil doings our Saviour's
coming into our world frustrates, whose power is
great, whose emissaries are innumerable, and
whose baneful suggestions and influence the Holy
Spirit alone can withstand, and quite another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thing to believe that Satan could give miraculous
attestation to a lie, as God did to the truth. If
there are some passages of Scripture that seem
to favour this false view, it behoves us to suspect,
having regard to the whole tenour of Scripture
affecting the doctrine, that the correct interpretation
has not been arrived at.</p>

<p>The existence of Satan, and his influence, personal,
and by the legions who fell with him, are
of course superhuman ideas, and in the category
of the miraculous; but there is a wide difference
between the most striking sign of his spiritual
power and the Divine miracles wrought to attest
the truth. It is God "who alone doeth great
wonders."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"If this man were not of God he could do
nothing."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "If I do not the works of my Father,
believe me not."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"A miracle is a sign for our faith, to be apprehended
in its Divine intention, though it cannot
be comprehended, because it is God's especial
work." When the magicians in the Court of
Pharaoh saw the miracles which Moses wrought,
they said, "This is the finger of God,"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is, and intended to be, the inevitable inference.
They knew that all they could do was a sham, a
pretence.</p>

<p>Counterfeits are as prominent in the history of
our race as any feature that could be specified,
and an imaginary devil is conspicuous in the category
of the spurious. If there had been no real
one, the counterfeit could scarcely have been
conceived. He is the father of lies, and how numerous
his progeny! While all else is misrepresented,
parodied, travestied, burlesqued, falsified,
belied, it would be strange if he had escaped.
From the Eternal Himself down to the most
insignificant thing that is worth a forgery, what a
catalogue may in an instant be specified! The
Divine law with its ceremonial rites, and the
Church with its ordinances; prophets and apostles;
gospels and epistles; science and philosophy;
history and biography; and, assuredly, miracles;
in short, all truth&mdash;stem, branch, twig, and leaf&mdash;is
more or less, and at one time or another, got
up artificially, and the spurious or adulterated
article offered, in competition with the genuine
one, to human credulity. This, if it makes absolute
truth difficult to buy, renders the injunction
to "sell it not," when bought, true wisdom. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
seems to be, and of course is, absurd to doubt the
genuineness of the currency of a nation because
spurious coins are met with, but I believe that
more scepticism is produced by the consideration
of the many religious impostures in the world
than by any other influence. The inference is
childish in the ignorant and unphilosophical in
the scholar, but it is often unconsciously arrived
at in many minds as a plain and easy solution of
the question which cannot be evaded&mdash;Is Divine
revelation a reality?</p>

<p>Our author misrepresents Christianity, and
uses the misrepresentation as an argument against
it, as, alas! is only too common. John Stuart
Mill actually says in his essay on Theism (p. 240)
that "Christ is never said to have declared any
evidence of His mission (unless His own interpretations
of the prophecies be so considered) except
internal conviction." If Mr. Mill ever read the
New Testament through, he would have found
where it is written, "Jesus answered and said
unto them, Go and show John again those things
which ye do hear and see: the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the
deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor
have the gospel preached to them. And blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is he, whosoever is not offended in me." And also
the words, "But I have greater witness than that
of John: for the works which the Father hath
given me to finish, the same works that I do,
bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent
me."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> "The Jews came round about him and
said, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If
thou be the Messiah, tell us plainly. Jesus
answered, I told you, and ye believed not: the
works that I do in my Father's name, they bear
witness of me."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "Believe me for the very
works' sake."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>How, in the face of such an authoritative statement
why miracles were wrought by Jesus, can
our author assume that they were not intended
to be an appeal to reason, and to be tested by the
intelligence and common sense they appealed to?
The miracles were wrought to convince men that
Jesus was the Messiah, and were adapted to that
end. Our author's picture of Divine revelation is
very much a conception of his own, fashioned from
isolated portions of Scripture, pseudo-Judaism,
and ecclesiastical representations of Christianity.</p>

<p>He quotes Archbishop Trench, who, in defining
the function of a miracle, says,&mdash;"A miracle does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not prove the truth of a doctrine or the divine
mission of him that brings it to pass;" and
Dr. Arnold, who says,&mdash;"It has always seemed
to me that its substance is a most essential part
of its evidence, and that miracles wrought in
favour of what was foolish or wicked would only
prove Manicheism:" which passages of fallible
commentators fail to express the distinction between
real miracles and spurious ones. But I ask,
Why does he appeal to what Dr. Trench and Dr.
Arnold, or any other commentator says, when
he has before him our Saviour's own words? In
arguing against miracles, it is not competent for
him to put his own construction upon them in
violation of the highest authority as to their purpose
and design. I understand his conclusions to
be against Christianity&mdash;not against what he is
pleased to put in its place. It is in the Fourth
Gospel we find Christ's words, but that book is
too important a part of Divine revelation for
any apologist to remain in the field of discussion
and continue the argument if his opponent,&mdash;whether
he be Mr. Mill or our author,&mdash;insists
on assuming that on the Christian side the
question is an open one whether the Fourth
Gospel is to be accepted. The whole of the four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Gospels as we have them were read in all the
Christian Churches on the three continents in the
middle of the second century, as our author well
knows. He acknowledges that Irenæus, who
wrote about <small>A.D.</small> 180, compared the four Gospels
to the "four columns of the Church over the
whole world;" and that in writings of his which
we have, and the genuineness of which no one
questions, there are hundreds of references to the
Gospels, the fourth included. There is no question
as to this being the fact at that date. It is
the earlier date that the argument bears upon.
The four Gospels are held together by an inseparable
bond in the archives of the Church,
and believers in them assert they will all four
stand or fall together. I can only suppose that it
was because Mr. Mill ignored the Fourth Gospel
that he ignored the verses I have quoted.</p>

<p>If an advocate has a weak case in hand, to
damage the character of the witnesses is a
well-known mode of proceeding; so our author
asks who are the men who, it is asserted, saw
these amazing performances? What were the
intellectual conditions of the age when they
occurred? "Did the Jews at the time of Jesus
possess such calmness of judgment and sobriety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of imagination as to inspire us with any confidence
in accounts of marvellous occurrences unwitnessed
except by them, and limited to their
time, which contradict all knowledge and all
experience? Were their minds sufficiently enlightened
and free from superstition to warrant
our attaching weight to their report of events of
such an astounding nature?" (Vol. i. p. 98.)</p>

<p>The reading of this sentence suggests a comparison
between the age he refers to and the
century succeeding Harvey's discovery of the circulation
of the blood, during which our Royal
College of Physicians repudiated the discovery,
some of the most eminent of the faculty writing
against it, and creating a prejudice against Harvey
by which his practice suffered considerably; and
the scientific period when the French Academy
for a long time rejected the use of quinine, vaccination,
lightning-conductors, the steam-engine,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>To weaken the apostolic testimony, there is presented
an elaborate exhibition of the wide-spread
belief among the Jews in sorcery, dreams, portents,
and numerous forms of superstition. In what age
have not these been prevalent? Are we free from
them in this? If the Divine communication had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
been postponed until now, and civilisation could
have attained to its present stage without its influence,
would its reception have been any different?
Would the vested interests in established
usages and beliefs have raised no opposition? If
there are in this country, and in this day, thousands
who believe, or pretend to believe, that the
priests who are ordained to forgive sins can really
do so, are we in a position to assume any great
superiority over the Jews, Greeks, and Romans of
eighteen centuries ago? If the most manifest
and stupendous miracle were wrought to show
men the folly of drunkenness, lying, and other
sins, would not the results be just the same?
Some would believe and testify, and others say
that the sign, not being of the precise sort to
suit them, was not conclusive. There must be a
coming down from the cross, or something else, to
satisfy them. "If they believe not Moses and the
prophets, neither would they believe though one
rose from the dead." The testimony of the first
disciples, it is said, is not satisfactory, because
they were uneducated, unscientific, uncritical.
Mr. Mill says Paul was the only exception in the
first generation of Christians. I remark that
Matthew, in the position of a receiver of taxes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Roman government, though not learned,
might be shrewd to detect imposture; that
Thomas was not too credulous; and that as for Paul, if
he could not judge of the value of the testimony of
the hundreds of men and women who told him, or
could have told him, what they were eye-witnesses
of, what was his education worth, and what about
the miracle in his own case? Why should it be
doubted that the vision to which he refers in his
unquestioned letter to the Galatians really occurred?
He therein tells them (with an asseveration
that, in the presence of God, he was not
lying)<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that he was taught the gospel he preached
by the revelation of Jesus Christ. Whatever may
be said about the authority of the Acts of the
Apostles, which relates the particulars of Paul's
miraculous conversion so minutely, we have the
evidence of it in Paul's own letter. Of course he
would compare what was revealed to him with
what the eye-witnesses could tell him; and if he
could mistake a sunstroke, a trance, or a state of
ecstatic dreaming for a Divine revelation, his
character, judged of by his own writings, is
verily incomprehensible. There is no such other
enigma in all history. In his equally unquestioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
letter to the Corinthians he tells them that
he received from the Lord the particulars of the
institution of the Lord's Supper. Of this memorable
event Paul had ample opportunities of comparing
what was revealed to him with what the
disciples who were present could tell him; and he
was in such intercourse with them, that the circumstances
were highly favourable for an educated
man, such as he was, arriving at the exact and
absolute truth of the matter.</p>

<p>Our author's view of the question is narrowed
by his refusing to acknowledge that mankind is
morally depraved by sin.</p>

<p>How a man, with the wickedness of such a
city as London daily forced on his notice, and
a knowledge of the history of the race in his
memory, could have penned such a sentence as the
following, it is difficult to conceive. "The whole
theory of this abortive design of creation, with
such important efforts to amend it, is emphatically
contradicted by the <i>glorious perfection and invariability</i>
of the order of nature." Can he not see
that the degradation and wickedness of humanity
are in striking <i>contrast</i> to the "glorious perfection
and invariability of the order of nature"? He is
bound to give some reason for this anomaly if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
will not accept what revelation makes known to
us as the cause.</p>

<p>The abstract question as to the credibility of
miracles Paul discussed in the year 58 at Cæsarea,
in the presence of Festus and Agrippa, when he
said, "Why should it be thought a thing incredible
with you that God should raise the dead?" and it
has been dealt with so exhaustively by Newton,
Locke, Butler, Paley, Whateley, Olinthus
Gregory, Wardlaw, Alexander, and a host of
other writers, that there is really little more to be
said. The "Fortnightly Review" remarks that
the arguments on both sides are so familiar, that it
is not necessary to reproduce the present author's
mode of dealing with this part of the subject.
Matthew Arnold describes it as an attempt to refute
Dr. Mozley's Bampton Lecture on Miracles&mdash;"a
solid reply to a solid treatise;" but that to
engage in an <i>à priori</i> argument to prove that miracles
are impossible, against an adversary who
argues, <i>à priori</i>, that they are possible, is the
vainest labour in the world. Now, as Mr. Arnold
is as much a disbeliever in miracles as our author,
the worth of his abstract argument may be taken
at Mr. Arnold's estimate, and he says: "The
author of 'Supernatural Religion' asserts again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and again that miracles are contrary to complete
induction, but no such law of nature has
been, or can be, established against the Christian
miracles, therefore <i>a complete induction there is
not</i>."</p>

<p>If the miracle-disbelieving Matthew Arnold does
not accept our author's abstract argument, and
since we find Mr. Mill designating "<i>two points</i>"
in Hume's celebrated attack as "weak" and
"vulnerable," I need not linger over this part of
the work. I may assume that it is sufficiently
neutralised by men on his own side of the question
as able and learned as himself.</p>

<p>But it is not only Mr. Mill and Mr. Arnold who
have recently shown that Hume's celebrated
argument, which our author reproduces and defends,
is not sound. It is satisfactory to know
that from Germany, where so much sceptical
criticism has been promulgated, comes now the
most complete and conclusive exposure of the
whole anti-Christian argument. For the proof of
this assertion I refer to a work which has just
been translated into English, and issued by Messrs.
T. and T. Clark of Edinburgh, entitled "Modern
Doubt and Christian Belief,"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> by Theodore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Christlieb, D.D., University Preacher and Professor
of Theology at Bonn; a most able, learned,
and exhaustive argument on the whole question,
equal to the demands of those who desire to know
all about it, and to whom I earnestly commend
the book. He mentions that the great majority
of the representatives of the present scientific
German theology are considered to have essentially
decided in favour of the faith, not only
on dogmatical, but also on exegetical and speculative
grounds (p. 289).</p>

<p>This is in strong contrast to the assertion of our
author (vol. i. p. 27), that "it may broadly be
said that English divines alone, at the present
day, maintain the reality and supernatural character
of such phenomena;" and that "the great
majority of modern German critics reject the
miraculous altogether, and consider the question
as no longer worthy of discussion."</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who may not have
time to read Dr. Christlieb's work, I will transcribe
a few passages bearing on the abstract
argument we are discussing.</p>

<p>"Things moral and spiritual cannot be mathematically
demonstrated. He who said, 'My
thoughts are not as your thoughts,' has introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
in His words and actions a far higher logic
than that whose principles Aristotle laid down."
(Preface, p. xi.)</p>

<p>"However much, in other respects, our opponents
may differ, they all agree in the denial of
miracles, and unitedly storm this bulwark of the
Christian faith; and in its defence we have to
combat them all at once. But whence this unanimity?
Because, with the truth of miracles,
the entire citadel of Christianity stands or falls.
For its beginning is a miracle, its Author is a miracle,
its progress depends upon miracles, and
miracles will hereafter be its consummation"
(p. 285).</p>

<p>"If the principle of miracles be set aside, then
all the heights of Christianity will be levelled
with one stroke, and nought will remain but a
heap of ruins. If we banish the supernatural
from the Bible, there is nothing left us but the
covers" (p. 286).</p>

<p>"The negation of miracles leads to the annihilation
of all religion" (p. 286).</p>

<p>"Many are averse to the miraculous through
fear of superstition, and they overlook the sharp
discrimination of Scripture between belief and
superstition, between miraculous power and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
witchcraft. Whereas the sorcerer pretends to
make supernatural powers subservient to <i>his</i>
person, the prophet or apostle accounts himself
only the instrument of God. It is God who
alone works. The Son Himself seeks through
His works not His own honour, but that of His
Father.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Notice the unobtrusiveness of miracles
in the holy Scriptures, how Christ sharply repels
the vain curiosity and vulgar thirst of His age
for wonders, and His prohibition of their publication.
Compare with these features the sensational
miracles of the Roman and Oriental
Churches&mdash;images of saints who sweat blood,
nod the head, roll the eyes&mdash;or the Whitsuntide
marvels among the Greeks and Armenians at
Jerusalem, when the Holy Ghost lights up candles
(but not hearts), and you will confess that such
feats of legerdemain jugglery betray, in their
external pomp and straining after effect, anything
but a Divine origin. A glance at the internal
evidences of the truth in miracles, at their moral
and religious character, which reflects and serves
not only the power of God, but also His truth
and holiness, and must prove pre-eminently their
Divine origin, will show that it is not a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
difficult task for any one to defend his belief in
the biblical miracles against the charge of superstition"
(p. 297).</p>

<p>"Those foundation-stones for the denial of all
miracles which were laid by Spinoza and Hume,
and on which the critics of the present day still
take a defiant stand, have crumbled away piecemeal
before our eyes. Spinoza's axiom, that the
'laws of nature are the only realisation of the
Divine will,' stands or falls with the pantheistic
conception of the Deity&mdash;a conception which is
not only unworthy of God and of man, but also
contrary to reason. The Source of all freedom
is supposed to have no freedom, but to be immured
in His own laws! And to this Spinoza
adds the conclusion: 'If anything could take
place in nature contrary to its laws, God would
thereby contradict Himself.' We have seen that
just the converse is true, namely, that if God
performed no miracles, and left the world to itself,
He would contradict Himself; that He must
perform miracles in order to maintain the end for
which the world was created, and to bring it to
the destiny which was originally intended. His
miraculous action contradicts not nature and its
laws, but the unnatural, which has entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
world through sin, and counteracts its destructive
consequences in order to restore the life of the
world to holy order. Only those who, like
Spinoza, deny the reality of sin and its destructive
power, can question the necessity of the
miraculous. The present condition, not only of
the human world, but also of nature, gives such
opinions the lie at every step" (p. 327).</p>

<p>"Hume, in like manner, bases his attack
against the miraculous on a series of false assumptions.
First: 'Miracles are violations of
the laws of nature.' This is false, since miracles,
far from violating, serve to re-establish the already
violated order of the world, and do not
injure the laws of nature. Second: 'But we
learn from experience that the laws of nature are
never violated.' This is false, because we ourselves
immediately interfere with our higher will
in the laws of nature, and interrupt them without
their being violated. Third: 'For miracles
we have the questionable testimony of a few
persons.' This is false, because the entire Scriptures
are full of miracles, and the historical
testimony for them is unquestionable, since the
appearance of Israel and of the Christian Church
is perfectly incomprehensible without miracles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
'But,' he goes on, 'against them we have universal
experience; therefore this stronger testimony
nullifies the weaker and more questionable.'
The pith of Hume's argument, then, is simply
this: Because, according to universal experience,
no miracles now take place, therefore none
can ever have occurred. This proposition, in the
first place, involves a begging of the question,
since it is not at all certain that no miracles
are performed now-a-days; and, second, it ignores
the fact that different periods are subject to different
laws, and with their varied wants may demand
varied kinds of revelatory action on the part of
God. Certainly, the negro who should affirm
that there is no snow, because in his country,
according to 'universal experience,' it never
snows, would be committing an absurdity. And
no less illegitimate is it to measure all time by
the universal (?) experience or non-experience of
some particular period. Finally, Hume goes on
to demand, as a condition for the credibility of
miracles, that they must be attested by an adequate
number of sufficiently educated and honest
persons, who could not be suspected of intentional
deception, and that they should be done
in so frequented a spot that the detection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
illusion would be inevitable. We shall see further
(in Lectures vi. and vii.) that these conditions
were all essentially fulfilled in the case of the
New Testament miracles. And yet, in spite of the
evident weakness of Hume's argument, Strauss
would have us believe that Hume's 'Essay on
Miracles' is so universally convincing, that it
may be said to have settled the question ('Leben
Jesu,' page 148). The author of the 'Life of
Christ' forgets to mention that Hume has long
since been refuted in detail by the earlier and
later English apologists (<i>e. g.</i>, by Campbell,
Adams, Hay, Price, Douglass, Paley, Whateley,
Dwight, Alexander, Wardlaw, and Pearson), to
say nothing of the Germans; but then he knows
that only a very small proportion of his readers is
aware of this fact" (p. 328).</p>

<p>"To these objections not even our most modern
philosophers have been able to add really new
ones; and as against them all we may confidently
maintain the following truths as the result of our
investigation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The possibility of the miraculous rests upon
the uninterrupted activity of a living God in the
world.</p>

<p>"Its necessity arises, on the one hand, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Divine end and aim of the world; and on the other,
from the disturbance introduced into its development
through sin.</p>

<p>"Therefore, although miracles are supernatural,
they are not unnatural. Far from violating
the conditions of life, of nature, or of humanity,
they re-establish the life of the world which has
already been deranged, and initiate the higher
order of things for which the universe was
created" (p. 328).</p>

<p>Of Baur, Dr. Christlieb writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of all modern opponents of our old faith,
the greatest is Dr. Ferdinand Christian von
Baur, Professor of Theology at Tübingen (died
December 2, 1860), one of the greatest, if not
the greatest theological scholar of this century;
after Neander, the most notable historian of the
Church, not only in Germany but in the world;
the most indefatigable of investigators, especially
as regards the history of Primitive Christianity,
in the elucidation of which he has deserved well
of theology. He stands a head and shoulders
above all our modern opponents of the miraculous....
If human power, human diligence, and
acuteness, could ever bring about the overthrow
of our faith, this man would have accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it. But our present theology is daily becoming
more convinced that he was incompetent to this
task, and that, in spite of all his unutterable exertions,
he did not succeed in proving the merely
natural origin of Christianity. This is one of the
surest signs that the rock upon which our faith
is founded is absolutely indestructible"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> (p. 505).</p>

<p>I must not attempt to give the points of Dr.
Christlieb's critique and refutation of the Tübingen
theory, but refer the reader to his invaluable work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3><i>THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS</i>.</h3>

<p class="center">CLEMENT OF ROME&mdash;THE EPISTLE OF BARNABAS&mdash;THE
PASTOR OF HERMAS.</p>


<p>The argument based on the investigation which
is carried on in the seven hundred pages of the
second and third parts of our author's work, is
chiefly the negative one from "silence." He examines
with great minuteness the date, character,
and authorship of all the four Gospels, and refers
to all the writings of the early Church for traces
of them; insisting upon the silence of those early
writings as being of as much importance as any
"supposed allusions" to the Gospels found in
such authors as Justin Martyr, Clement of Rome,
and others who lived soon after the apostolic age;
the result being, in our author's opinion, unfavourable
to the view entertained by orthodox
believers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>I demur to his conclusions. I notice a want of
fairness in some of his quotations and in some of
his translations, and a want of accuracy in some
of his statements, as well as defects in his reasoning,
which I have no doubt others will comment
upon who may review the book. Some of these
defects will appear as I proceed.</p>

<p>When I find him saying, as he does, vol. ii.
page 387, "We must, however, carefully restrict
ourselves to the limits of our inquiry, and resist
any temptation to enter upon an exhaustive discussion
of the problem presented by the Fourth
Gospel from a more <i>general</i> literary point of view,"
I expect to find difficulties, which of course there
are and must be, brought into prominence and
carped at, while the general evidence upon which
Divine revelation is immovably based is "carefully"
avoided.</p>

<p>The second part, on the Synoptic Gospels, is
a long investigation, extending over five hundred
pages, and dealing with three and twenty works
by separate non-biblical authors of the first and
second centuries; and its object is to disprove that
they were written solely by Matthew, Mark, and
Luke, and to support the hypothesis that those
Gospels were not in existence until long after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
times of the apostles, and, therefore, that they
furnish no evidence from eye-witnesses of the
miracles they record.</p>

<p>The third part deals with the Fourth Gospel in
a similar manner, and occupies more than two
hundred pages. Our author's inquiry into the
reality of Divine revelation seems, at this point,
to involve the following questions: Does the extant
literature of the close of the first and the
beginning of the second century quote from, or
allude to, the three Synoptic Gospels? And if this
cannot be answered in the affirmative, does such
silence prove they were not then written; and, if
so, is the conclusion deducible that the miracles
recorded are not credible?</p>

<p>In the preliminary remarks with which he opens
the second part, he says: "When such writers,
quoting largely from the Old Testament and other
sources, deal with subjects which would naturally
be assisted by references to our Gospels, and still
more so by quoting such works as authoritative,
and yet we find that not only <i>they do not show
any knowledge of those Gospels</i>, but actually quote
passages from unknown sources, or sayings of
Jesus derived from tradition, the inference must
be that our Gospels were either unknown, or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
recognised as works of any authority at the time."
In reference to this sentence I remark that many
of the passages he specifies and examines are <i>not</i>
from <i>unknown sources</i>, but from the Gospels, because,
if not strictly verbatim, they are in the <i>sense</i>
identical, and almost identical in the language;
therefore such quotations are evidence that the
Gospels existed at the time. The insinuation that
they are from tradition is purely conjecture, and
altogether improbable, because our Gospels contain
the passages. There is not the slightest reason
for looking away from our gospels, and imagining
the quotations to be either from unknown sources
or tradition. This will appear as we proceed. I
will give in his own words the results of his examination
of what he designates "evidence for
the Synoptic Gospels," and then follow him step
by step through the journey he takes into early
Patristic Church history.</p>

<p>He says (vol. ii. page 248): "We may now
briefly sum up the results of our examination of
the evidence for the Synoptic Gospels. After
having exhausted the literature and the testimony
bearing on the point, we <i>have not found a single
distinct trace of any of those Gospels during the first
century and a half after the death of Jesus</i>. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
once during the whole of that period do we find
any tradition even that any one of our Evangelists
composed a Gospel at all, and that tradition, so
far from favouring our Synoptics, is fatal to the
claims of the first and second. Papias, about the
middle of the second century, on the occasion to
which we refer, records that Matthew composed
the Discourses of the Lord in the Hebrew tongue,
a statement which <i>totally excludes the claim of our
Greek Gospel to apostolic origin</i>. Mark, he said,
wrote down from the casual preaching of Peter
the sayings and doings of Jesus, but without
orderly arrangement, as he was not himself a follower
of the Master, and merely recorded what fell
from the apostle. This description likewise shows
that our actual Second Gospel could not in its present
form have been the work of Mark. There is
no other reference during the period to any writing
of Matthew or Mark, and no mention at all of any
work ascribed to Luke. If it be considered that
there is any connection between Marcion's Gospel
and our Third Synoptic, any evidence so derived is
of an unfavourable character for that Gospel, as it
involves a charge against it of being interpolated
and debased by Jewish elements. Any argument
for the mere existence of our Synoptics, based<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
upon their supposed rejection by heretical leaders
and sects, has the evitable disadvantage that the
very testimony which would show their existence
would oppose their authenticity. There is no evidence
of their use by heretical leaders, however,
and no direct reference to them by any writer,
heretical or orthodox, whom we have examined.
We need scarcely add that no reason whatever
has been shown for accepting the testimony of
these Gospels as sufficient to establish the reality
of miracles and of a direct Divine revelation."
(Here he says, in a foot-note: "A comparison of
the contents of the three Synoptics would have
confirmed the conclusion, but this is not at present
necessary, and we must hasten on.") "It
is not pretended that more than one of the Synoptic
Gospels was written by an eye-witness of
the miraculous occurrences reported; and whilst
no evidence has been, or can be, produced even of
the historical accuracy of the narratives, no testimony
as to the correctness of the inferences from
the external phenomena exists or is now even
conceivable. The discrepancy between the amount
of evidence required and that which is forthcoming,
however, is greater than under the circumstances
could have been thought possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>There is a plausibility, combined with an
assumed conclusiveness, in this summary, which
may impose for a moment on those readers of his
book who are not conversant with the question
under discussion. They will be likely to have
glanced at the foot-notes indicating the great
number of books referred to, and take it for
granted that an author so learned and painstaking
would scarcely have asserted conclusions
so boldly without having found good reasons for
them, which, before he has done, he will adduce
and make plain. It is evident, however, that
whatever his reasons may be as a whole, when his
promised further volume has been published, it is
quite certain that, so far, his argument from the
silence of early writings, supposing he had conducted
it successfully, combined with his logic on
the abstract question of the credibility of miracles,
is not sufficient to justify his assertion that the
testimony of the Gospels is insufficient to establish
the reality of miracles; because the Gospels
might have existed, although no trace of them
can be found in the fragments extant of books
written during the few years between the composition
of the Gospels and the period when they
were generally acknowledged as authoritative, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
read everywhere in the Christian assemblies on
the Lord's Day, that is, from about <small>A.D.</small> 100 to 150.</p>

<p>The reader will be unwise if he allow himself
to be impressed by the multiplicity of selected
witnesses from a selected period, other evidence
being unappealed to. If a hundred of witnesses
are, in a court of justice, produced to swear to the
identity of a man, the impression is created that it
cannot but be established. We have lately seen
how from being inevitable is such an outside
verdict. The special pleading of authorship, like
that of the Queen's Bench, startles and impresses
for a moment; but after the investigation of all
the facts and circumstances of the case is complete,
and the judge has dissected the evidence,
the sophistry is found not to have helped the side
which used it, but has tended to strengthen the
other. I remark, before following our author in
his references to the witnesses he has selected for
cross-examination, it is not conceded to him the
right to draw a line where it best suits him in
Church history, and decide the case in the absence
of the evidence of witnesses on the outside of it.
He draws such a line in specifying "<i>the first
century and a half after the death of Christ</i>." If
the probable date of Christ's birth be the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
year before the commencement of the Christian
era, we have this line drawn at <small>A.D.</small> 180, at which
point the second generation of Christians had only
just passed away, when direct tradition had not
lost its freshness. While men and women were
living who had heard from eye-witnesses of the
events of Christ's life on earth, the story of His
advent, death, resurrection, and ascension, the
books recording the facts for future ages were
in a less prominent position in the Church than
immediately afterwards. They were then read in
all the Churches, but commentaries on them and
written references to them were not very numerous;
therefore what we can trace of such before
that time is comparatively scanty. But, immediately
afterwards, in the third and fourth generation
of Christians, when there were no men living
who could say, My grandfather or my venerable
teacher told me so and so of Christ, and he saw
Christ in Galilee after His resurrection, when
there were not less than five hundred of His
disciples assembled, and he was present when He
ascended in a cloud&mdash;while such persons were
living, the testimony of a book was to them of
lesser weight and importance, for they could say
that they had the truth, not from the written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
words of a disciple, but from his own lips. As
Irenæus well remembered Polycarp, so might persons
living about the middle of the second century
remember the teaching of the Apostle John.
The argument from "silence," applied to the
early period restricted to the year 180, is for this
and other reasons far from being conclusive,
while the evidence furnished by such writings as
those of Irenæus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria,
Theophilus of Antioch, Tatian, Hippolytus,
and Origen, who belong to the subsequent years
of the first and the opening of the second century,
is much more important than is indicated by
our author. His investigation ignores to a great
extent the circumstantial evidence of this later
period. He says (vol. ii. p. 387) he "must be
careful to restrict himself to the limits of his
inquiry," and to avoid the "more general literary
point of view," and he does so restrict himself.
If a person really desires to decipher an obscure
antiquarian manuscript or inscription, he does not
say, I must carefully keep to this imperfectly-lighted
room, and not step into broad daylight.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of the way he draws an
inference. In arguing against the authority of
the four Gospels, he says, vol. ii. p. 457, "No two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of them agree even about so simple a matter of
fact as the inscription on the cross." Now the
exact words, as given in each Gospel, are as
follows: Matthew gives the inscription in eight
words&mdash;"This is Jesus the King of the Jews;"
Mark in five words&mdash;"The King of the Jews;"
Luke in seven words&mdash;"This is the King of the
Jews;" and John in eight words&mdash;"Jesus of
Nazareth the King of the Jews."</p>

<p>This needs no comment. Could anything be
more natural than such slight discrepancies?
Would four shorthand reporters of the present
day have been more exact?</p>

<p>The first early writer he examines is Clement,
Bishop of Rome, who, towards the close of the
first century, wrote an epistle to the Corinthians.
It is attached to the ancient copy of the Scriptures
known as the Codex Alexandrinus, written
in the fifth century, and preserved in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>This writer's fame surpassed all others in the
first century. His first Epistle to the Corinthians,
written in Greek, is deemed to be genuine; but,
says Dr. Mosheim, "it seems to have been corrupted
and interpolated."</p>

<p>Eusebius assures us it was received by all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
reverenced next to the Holy Scriptures, and
therefore publicly read in the Churches for some
ages, even till his time.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The epistle itself makes no mention of the
author's name. It purports to be addressed by
"the Church of God which sojourns at Rome to
the Church of God sojourning at Corinth." But
in the Codex Alexandrinus the title of "The First
Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians" is added
at the end. Internal evidence shows it was
written after some persecution of the Church,
either that of Nero, <small>A.D.</small> 64-70, or Domitian, at
the end of the century. The epistle contains
these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Especially remembering the words of the
Lord Jesus, which he spake teaching gentleness
and long-suffering. For thus he said, Be pitiful,
that ye may be pitied; forgive, that it may be forgiven
you; as ye do, so shall it be done to you; as
ye give, so shall it be given to you; as ye judge, so
shall it be judged to you; as ye show kindness,
shall kindness be shown to you; with what
measure ye mete, with the same it shall be
measured to you."</p>

<p>Our author himself shows that these precepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
cannot be mere floating tradition. He says such
"seems impossible" (vol. i. p. 226). They are
evidently the words of Jesus taken from a written
source, but he contends that they are not a
quotation from the Sermon on the Mount, as recorded
in the Gospels as we have them, but <i>from
some other Gospel</i> which is not extant. He says:
"When the great difference is considered between
the parallel passages in Matthew and Luke, and
still more between these and the passage in
Mark, it is easy to understand that that other
Gospel may have contained a version differing as
much from them as they do from each other."</p>

<p>I remark, supposing that Clement had before
him all three versions, which differ from each
other, what is more natural than that he should
give the sense without adhering to the exact words
of any. Only an inquirer who has a bias against
Christianity would think of disputing the quotation.</p>

<p>If Epiphanius "clearly wrote without having the
Gospel of Luke before him," as our author states
on page 100, and if Tertullian "evidently quotes
that Gospel from memory," as he also says on the
same page; why should it be assumed as a matter
of course that Clement had the writings before
him? He also may have quoted from memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>There is something strangely marvellous about
the disappearance of these imaginary lost records
of the Sermon on the Mount. We know that in
the year <small>A.D.</small> 139 Justin Martyr wrote that the
"Memoirs of the Apostles," called "Evangels"
(gospels), were read after the prophets every Lord's
Day in the assembly of the Christians. Where
were they then? Were they identical with these
memoirs called Gospels? Where were they about
the year <small>A.D.</small> 180, when Irenæus proves that four
Gospels were held in the highest esteem, and were
read in all the Churches; alluding to them as the
four columns of the Church, and comparing them
to the four quarters of the world, the four principal
winds, and the four figures of the Cherubim?
Where were they when he says: "So well established
<i>are our Gospels</i>, that even teachers of error
themselves bear testimony to them: even they
rest their objections on the foundations of the
Gospels"?<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This hypothesis of our author is
certainly going out of the way to find the reason
for a thing. It is to be remembered that what is
evidenced by Irenæus, who wrote about <small>A.D.</small> 180,
and was the pupil of Polycarp, is highly important.
Dr. Mosheim says his five books against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
heresies, the only writings of his extant, are a
splendid monument of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> From the evidence
of Irenæus, it is clear that the four Gospels
must have been occupying a special and authoritative
place in the Church some time before the
time he wrote his five books on heresies, about
the year 180. Tischendorf, who knows as much
as any man about the Scripture manuscripts,
says: "It is a well-established fact that, already
between <small>A.D.</small> 150 and 200, not only were the
Gospels translated into Latin and Syriac, but also
that their number was defined to be only four,
neither more nor less." The Syriac version of the
New Testament called the Peshito, a work of immense
value, as the language is almost identical
with that spoken by Christ, a translation admirably
executed, "is generally assigned," says
Tischendorf, "to the end of the second century,
though we have not any positive proof to offer;"
and "the Latin version had acquired before this
period a certain public authority." As the man
who translated Irenæus's five books from Greek
into Latin follows the Italic version, and as Tertullian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in the quotation which he makes from the
Latin translation of Irenæus copies that translator,
Tischendorf justly argues that some time must
have elapsed between that date when the translation
is known to have been in existence, and the
period when they were first separated from other
Church writings, and attained a prominent and
sacred character. Thus we get to the apostolic
age for the origin of all the four Gospels, and there
seems to be no interval of time sufficient to account
for our author's primitive Gospels to have
disappeared, leaving no trace of their existence.
It is enormously more probable that the four
Gospels alluded to by Irenæus and Tertullian contained
the records from which Clement quoted
the passage of the Sermon on the Mount, than
that there were primitive independent writings
which were soon lost, obtaining no recognition
when the separate Gospel manuscripts became
associated with the Old Testament, and were
read after them in the Christian assemblies. Our
author says the passage quoted by Clement, referring
to the Sermon on the Mount, is decidedly
opposed to "the pretensions made on behalf of
the Synoptics." I do not quite know what "pretensions"
he alludes to, but I am not defending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pretensions, either ecclesiastical or non-ecclesiastical.
It is not necessary, in the defence of the
Gospels, to assert that the four Evangelists whose
names are attached to them wrote every word;
that they only contain records of what those disciples
were either eye-witnesses of, or, in the case
of Mark and Luke, heard Peter and Paul preach.
The formulæ, "according to Matthew," "according
to Mark," "according to Luke," "according
to John," do not imply that, in the most
ancient opinion, these recitals were written from
beginning to end by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It is enough to know that the writings so
far emanated from those disciples as to justify the
titles they bear, and their reception by the early
Church, as the true record of the important
transactions to which they refer. That reception
of them was sufficiently near to the date of their
composition to preclude the probability that the
early Christian Church had not the means of
testing their genuineness or historical data, while
their internal evidence is such as to confirm their
truthfulness and authority.</p>

<p>"As to Luke," says Rénan, "doubt is scarcely
possible. It is a regular composition, founded on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
anterior documents, the work of one man, who
selects, prunes, and combines. The author is
certainly the same as that of the Acts of the
Apostles. Now the author of the Acts is a companion
of Paul, a title which applies to Luke
exactly. The name of Lucus (contraction of
Lucanus) being very rare, we need not fear one
of those homonyms which cause so many perplexities
in questions of criticism relative to the
New Testament. It is beyond doubt that the
author of the Third Gospel and of the Acts was
a man of the second generation, and that is
sufficient for our object. The date can be determined
by considerations drawn from the Gospel
itself. The twenty-first chapter, inseparable
from the rest of the work, was certainly written
a short time after the destruction of Jerusalem.
We are here upon solid ground, for we are concerned
with a work written entirely by the same
hand, and of the most perfect unity. If the Gospel
of Luke is dated, those of Matthew and Mark are
dated also; for it is certain that the Third Gospel
is posterior to the first two, and exhibits the
character of a much more advanced composition."</p>

<p>"Every one drew largely on the Gospel tradition
then current. The Acts of the Apostles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
ancient Fathers quote many words of Jesus
which appear authentic, and are not found in the
Gospels we possess. The life of Jesus in the
Synoptics rests upon two original documents&mdash;first,
the discourses of Jesus collected by Matthew;
second, the collection of anecdotes and personal
reminiscences which Mark wrote from the recollections
of Peter. We may say that we have
these two documents still, mixed with accounts
from another source, in the two first Gospels,
which bear, not without reason, the name of the
Gospel according to Matthew, and of the Gospel
according to Mark. It was when tradition became
weakened, in the second half of the second
century, that the texts bearing the name of the
apostles took a decisive authority, and obtained
the force of law."</p>

<p>I have selected these passages from Rénan's
"Life of Jesus," as they bear upon the view of
the origin of the Gospels which may be entertained
with consistency by those who accept their
authority, without insisting upon any such pretensions
as our author seems to combat, and
which are not necessary for their defence.</p>

<p>I object also to the case being tried upon an
indictment which includes a uniform, plenary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and verbal inspiration. Nor is it, I submit,
necessary to defend the view that the Old and
New Testaments include no words but what are
of Divine authority.</p>

<p>I maintain that God has supernaturally revealed
His character and His will in the Bible,
but I know not where the hard and fast line is
which separates the human from the superhuman
in our versions of these sacred documents, the
general characteristic of which is that they are
inspired productions; that therein "holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "Not the words which man's wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>"God at sundry times and in divers manners
spake in time past unto the fathers," and having
subsequently spoken by His Son, authenticates
His message, which, we cannot doubt, the Holy
Spirit inspired the apostles to record, by a special
inspiration, as He did in pre-Christian times.</p>

<p>It is human nature for man to pervert even his
best of blessings. Jews and Christians alike have
done so. When we think of the translators of
the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek altering the
prophetical dates, to mislead as to the coming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Messiah, as was done in the Septuagint Version;
of the genealogy of Joseph being fitted into three
periods of fourteen generations each, to square
with Jewish notions of numerical precision and
completeness; of the verse in John's first epistle
(v. 7) inserted in the text to add strength to the
theological phraseology of a creed; and of the first
verses of the eighth chapter of the Fourth Gospel
being left out in several of the most ancient MSS.,
evidently owing to some great authority, such as
Eusebius (who was ordered by Constantine to
prepare copies of the Scriptures), having suppressed
them; we cannot but be suspicious that
human infirmity and meddlesomeness have, to
some extent, interfered with the transmission of
the Divine oracles. The fountain is undoubtedly
pure, but has not the channel been polluted
through which the Divine truths have been transmitted?</p>

<p>We have next a reference to the "Epistle of
Barnabas" and the "Pastor of Hermas," both of
which are attached to that ancient copy of the
Scriptures known as the Codex Sinaiticus, recently
found by Tischendorf, in a monastery in the desert
of Sinai, and now preserved at St. Petersburg.
It is the most ancient MS. of the Scriptures we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
can refer to, and is supposed to have been written
in the fourth century.</p>

<p>After the New Testament, in this valuable
MS., is placed the epistle ascribed to Barnabas.
It is complete. It was written some time between
the year 70 and the close of the first century,
and it contains these words:&mdash;"<i>Let us therefore
beware lest we should be found as it is written, Many
are called, few are chosen.</i>" These words certainly
appear to be quoted from the twenty-second chapter
of Matthew, but our author says there is a
similar passage in the apocryphal book of Ezra&mdash;"<i>There
be many created, but few shall be saved</i>,"
and he asks us to believe it is quoted from the
latter. As we have not the same bias as he has,
we decline, for obvious reasons, to do so, although
he points out that the verse in Matthew is not
in the oldest codex. Unfortunately the one in
the British Museum is defective at that part, but
the verse appears in later MSS. He says, had
the Epistle of Barnabas been seriously regarded
as a work of the apostle of that name, it could
scarcely have failed to attain canonical rank.
If this be our author's opinion, there was more
discrimination used by the men who decided
what writings were admissible into the canon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
than he has elsewhere given them credit for.
The Epistle of Barnabas also contains the following
important passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>But when he selected his own apostles, who should
preach his gospel, who were sinners above all sin, in
order that he might show that he came not to call the
righteous, but sinners, then he manifested himself to be
the Son of God.</i>"</p>

<p>Our author says that the words "<i>he came not
to call the righteous, but sinners</i>," very probably a
pious scribe added in the margin, and they were
afterwards included in the text of the epistle.</p>

<p>I remark that this is quite a gratuitous assumption.
I see no probability of anything of the kind,
and I agree with Tischendorf, who asks, "Could
any one mistake the words being a quotation from
Matt. ix. 13?" But our author insinuates that
this chapter should be dissected, and the miraculous
eliminated. He says the words of Jesus,
"They that be whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick," "evidently belong to the oldest
tradition of the Gospel;" and he gives the opinion
of Ewald, who ascribed them (ver. 1214), apart
from the remainder of the chapter, originally to
the <i>collection of discourses</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> from which, with two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
intermediate books, he considers our present Gospel
of Matthew was composed.</p>

<p>These are the sort of conjectures upon which
our author builds his argument. The ninth chapter
of Matthew is too full of the miraculous to be
accepted as a whole. It records how Jesus forgave
sins, to the sick gave health, to the blind
sight, to the dumb speech, and to the dead life; all
of which is out of keeping with his bias and the
German rationalism with which he has such profound
sympathy.</p>

<p>Tischendorf finds a further analogy between the
Epistle of Barnabas and the Gospel of Matthew
in the words, "<i>David prophesied, The Lord said
unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make thine
enemies thy footstool</i>;" and inquires, "Could Barnabas
so write without the supposition that his
readers had Matt. xxii. 4 before them? and does
not such a supposition likewise infer the actual
authority of Matthew's Gospel?" Because the passage
is in the Psalms, our author ridicules Tischendorf's
inference. It is, to say the least, quite as
probable that Barnabas quoted from the Gospel
as from the Psalms, and there is propriety in
Tischendorf's opinion and inference.</p>

<p>In designating his argument "rabid" and "preposterous,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
our author exposes himself to arrows
winged with similar feathers. When he unwarrantably
pretends to <i>know</i> that the earliest
records of what Jesus did and taught did not contain
anything but what comports with the German
school of theology which he favours, and which
he has done his best to make familiar to English
readers, without exposing himself personally to
the odium which attaches to such opinions in a
Christian community, he has no claim to indulgence
from those who examine his language
and animadvert thereupon.</p>

<p>Considering that, according to his own showing,
the belief was, at all events, prevalent in the
Christian Church in the middle of the second
century that these writings of the apostles were
authentic, and that he cannot account for their
being so esteemed, so soon after the events occurred
to which they refer, as to be universally
read in all the Christian Churches; it is, to say
the least, unbecoming in him to exalt his conjectures
into oracles. Other critics, quite as
inquiring, able, and learned, more modestly say,
"<i>The subject presents a variety of embarrassing circumstances,
so that it is difficult to arrive at a satisfactory
conclusion</i>." He lays himself open to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
classified with those who "<i>rush in where angels
fear to tread</i>." There is a close analogy between
those who say in their hearts there is
no God, and those who say He has never spoken;
and we know what is said in the Bible of the
former.</p>

<p>I will give here a specimen of the way our
author quotes to suit his own argument, and you
will see whether the epithet "<i>preposterous</i>" is at
all applicable to him.</p>

<p>In showing how much John was opposed to
Paul on the question of Gentile Christians observing
Jewish rites, he says, "<i>Allusion is undoubtedly
made to Paul in the Epistle to the Churches</i>,
in the Apocalypse;" and, "<i>It is clear that Paul is
referred to in the address to the Church of Ephesus</i>."
The first passage is Rev. ii. 2, "<i>I know thy works
and thy patience, ... and how thou hast tried them
which say they are apostles and are not, and hast found
them false</i>;" implying that John was so opposed to
Paul as to deny his being an apostle, which is
grossly improbable.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But the full absurdity of the
idea is more manifest in the next quotation from
Rev. ii. 14: "But I have a few things against thee
because thou hast there them that hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast
a stumbling-block before the children of Israel,
to eat things sacrificed unto idols," <i>&amp;c.</i> It would
not have answered his purpose to finish the sentence,
so he stops at the word "idols," and puts
"<i>&amp;c.</i>" When I mention that the words which are
represented by the "<i>&amp;c.</i>" are "<i>and to commit fornication</i>,"
you will agree with me, that not only is
the idea of John saying that Paul had taught the
Christians at Pergamos to sin in this respect the
climax of absurdity, but that an author who quotes
so unfairly, and reasons so strangely, is not to be
implicitly trusted, nor his conclusions accepted.
He has adopted the erroneous notion of Baur, the
late eminent Professor of Theology at Tübingen,
and other German writers, that the difference
between the Jewish and Christian converts, in
reference to circumcision and other Jewish observances,
amounted to a party contest, which
caused Paul and Peter and James to be seriously
at variance. Now we know the facts of the temporary
disagreement, and they certainly do not
justify such a conclusion. The hypothesis of
such a Pauline and a Petrine contest needs only
to be brought into contact with the letters of
Paul, in which he refers frequently to the Gentile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Churches sending help to the Jewish church at
Jerusalem, and it is at once exploded. He tells
the Galatians how it was arranged at Jerusalem,
after the matters in dispute had been discussed,
that he and Barnabas, receiving the right hand of
fellowship, should go to the heathen, and James,
Peter, and John to the circumcision; only the
latter stipulated that the poor at Jerusalem were
to be remembered, which Paul says, "I was forward
to do." And he instructs the Corinthians
in his first epistle as to their collections on the
first day of the week before he came, that their
liberality might be ready to send to the poor saints
at Jerusalem. There is here the very opposite
of such extreme hostile and disgraceful party
feeling as must have existed if John could indulge
in such language regarding Paul as our author
attributes to him. There were false men, such as
Simon the sorcerer; false apostles, such as Paul
alludes to; and corrupters of morals, such as the
Nicolaitanes; so that there is not the slightest
necessity to think of Paul and his dispute about
Jewish rites, to make the words of the Apocalypse
intelligible.</p>

<p>Clement's letter, written from Rome to the
Corinthians, probably about the year 94 or 95,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
supplies us with evidence as to the nature of
the difference between Peter and Paul, as well
as proves the epistle to be genuine. He says,
"Do take up the writings of the blessed apostle.
What did he say to you in the beginning of the
Gospel? Truly, by Divine Inspiration, he gave
you directions concerning himself and Peter and
Apollos, because even then ye were splitting into
parties. But your party spirit at that time had
less evil in it, because it was exercised in favour
of apostles of eminent holiness, and of <i>one</i> much
approved of by them. But now consider <i>who</i> they
are that have subverted you. These are shameful
things, brethren, very shameful, that the ancient
and flourishing Church of Corinth have quarrelled
with their pastors, from a weak partiality for one
or two persons."</p>

<p>Clement contrasts the eminent holy Peter and
Paul and Apollos with the persons who were subverting
them, and the latter were undoubtedly the
sort of false apostles that John alludes to in the
Apocalypse. The evidence of the Second Epistle
of Peter is not to be set aside because our author
includes it among the questionable writings of the
New Testament; and Peter there speaks of Paul
as "our beloved brother, who according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
wisdom given him hath written unto you."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It
is not convenient for such critics to allow the letter
to be genuine, on account of this very passage.
But there is ample proof, from internal evidence,
as shown by Dr. Macnight, Dr. Blackwell, and
Dr. A. Clarke, that it is a genuine letter. What
a weak case he must have in hand who has to
resort to such means to defend it!</p>

<p>The foregone conclusion that miracles are incredible,
hampers all the investigations of these
German scholars, and compels them to resort to
all sorts of conjectures and devices to account
for things which, on the basis of Evangelical
views, are neither mysterious nor inharmonious.
If it be true of Germany that her ablest theologians
are now exploding such fallacies, the
argument of our author is one, the force of which
is expended, a gun brought into the field of battle
when the fight is nearly over. It may do some
damage, but cannot affect materially the issue of
the contest. The outspokenness of the sceptics
has roused the believers, and the result, we cannot
doubt, will be for the furtherance of the
gospel.</p>

<p>"The natural and spiritual miracles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sacred narrative are only the notes of a higher
harmony which resound throughout the discords
of earthly history. To our dull sense indeed they
may seem disconnected, but the more we listen
the more we perceive a connected law of higher
euphony, now presaging, and finally bringing
about the solution of all dissonance into an
eternal harmony. Surely then a believer may
look down with pity upon the spirit of the age
and its declaration, that the harmony of the
Kosmos is destroyed by the miracles of the Bible."
(Beyschlag.)</p>

<p>The "Shepherd of Hermas" is next alluded
to, but as it is not pretended that it contains
any quotation from, or reference to, any passage
of the Old or New Testament, it is simply a
negative witness in this case. It is found in the
Codex Sinaiticus, after the Epistle of Barnabas.
The following is Mosheim's description of
the work: "The book entitled the 'Shepherd
of Hermas' (so called because an angel is the
leading character in the drama) was composed in
the second century, by Hermas, the brother of
Pius, the Roman bishop. The writer, if he was
indeed sane, deemed it proper to forge dialogues
held with God and angels, in order to insinuate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
what he regarded as salutary truths more effectually
into the minds of his readers. But his
celestial spirits talk more insipidly than our
scavengers and porters."</p>

<p>What a contrast between the writings of the
New Testament and those left out of the canon
does such a book as this "Shepherd of Hermas"
exhibit! Bunsen thus alludes to it: "That good
but dull novel which Niebuhr used to say he
pitied the Athenian Christians for being obliged
to hear read in their meetings." "From the
very dawn of Catholic literature, beginning with
'Hermas the Shepherd,' it had been the object of
the Christian writers to render the Greek and
Roman mind, by degrees, independent of the
heathen philosophers, and to create a Catholic
literature and library, more particularly for the
use of children and catechumens."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Failing to distinguish between what was intended
to be true, what was meant to be fiction,
and what was fraudulently spurious, theologians
have often been misled, and important doctrines
have been thereby perverted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">THE EPISTLES OF IGNATIUS&mdash;THE EPISTLE OF
POLYCARP&mdash;JUSTIN MARTYR&mdash;HEGESIPPUS&mdash;PAPIAS&mdash;THE
CLEMENTINES&mdash;THE EPISTLE
TO DIOGNETUS.</p></blockquote>


<p>Next our author examines quotations in "the
Epistles of Ignatius," though he says they really
appertain to a very much later period, for they
are "all pronounced, by a <i>large mass of critics,
spurious compositions</i>." He suffered martyrdom, it is said, on
the 20th December, <small>A.D.</small> 115, when he was condemned
to be cast to wild beasts in the amphitheatre, not at Rome, but
at Antioch, in consequence of the fanatical
excitement produced by the earthquake which
took place on the thirteenth of that month.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> If
any of his fifteen letters, says our author, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
be accepted as genuine, the references to them
might be important. Dr. Mosheim says his whole
epistles are extremely dubious. The shorter of
the two versions of Ignatius is, however, generally
allowed to be genuine. Tischendorf says "its
genuineness is now generally admitted." In it
we find, "What would a man be profited if he
should gain the whole world and lose his own
soul?" which of course is a quotation from Matt.
xvi. 26.</p>

<p>The next document mentioned is the Epistle of
Polycarp to the Philippians, who, Irenæus says,
was in his youth a disciple of the Apostle John.
He was Bishop of Smyrna, and ended his life by
martyrdom, <small>A.D.</small> 167. Irenæus knew Polycarp personally.
It is said that the epistle was written
before <small>A.D.</small> 120. Our author ascribes it to a later
date, and says that there are potent reasons for
considering it spurious. As, however, Irenæus,
Polycarp's disciple, believed it to be genuine, we
shall take the liberty of differing from our author,
and of believing it to be so. The epistle contains
the following: "Remembering what the Lord
said, teaching: Judge not, that ye be not judged;
forgive, and it shall be forgiven you; be pitiful, that
ye may be pitied; with what measure you mete it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall be measured to you again; and that blessed
are the poor, and those that are persecuted for
righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
God." Also: "Beseeching in our prayers the all-seeing
God not to lead us into temptation, as the
Lord said, The spirit indeed is willing, but the
flesh is weak." Also: "If, therefore, we pray the
Lord that he may forgive us, we ought also ourselves
to forgive."</p>

<p>Our author demurs to these being quotations
from our Gospels, and says they might have been
from orally current accounts of the Sermon on the
Mount, or from many of the records of the teaching
of Jesus in circulation.</p>

<p>Hegisippus is the next early writer referred to.
He made use of the "Gospel according to the
Hebrews." Jerome says (confirming Eusebius)
"that the Gospel according to the Hebrews is
written in the Chaldaic and Syriac (Syro-Chaldaic)
language, but with Hebrew characters."</p>

<p>We have, says our author, direct intimation
that Hegesippus made use of the Gospel according
to the Hebrews. "He was one of the contemporaries
of Justin&mdash;a Palestinian Jewish
Christian. In order to make himself thoroughly
acquainted with the state of the Church, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
travelled widely, and came to Rome when Anicitus
was bishop. <i>Subsequently he wrote a work
of historical memoirs in five books</i>, and thus became
the first ecclesiastical historian of Christianity.
This <i>work is lost</i>, but <i>portions have been preserved by
Eusebius</i>, and one other fragment is <i>also extant</i>."
It must have been written after the succession of
Eleutherius to the Roman bishopric (<small>A.D.</small> 177-193),
as that event is mentioned in the book.</p>

<p>"The testimony of Hegesippus is of <i>great value</i>,
not only as a man born near the primitive Christian
tradition, but also as that of an intelligent
traveller amongst many Christian communities"
(p. 430).</p>

<p>Hegesippus says, in the fifth book of his
Memoirs, that "these words ('Good things prepared
for the righteous neither eye hath seen nor
ear heard, nor have they entered into the heart of
man,' from 1 Cor. ii. 9) are vainly spoken, and
that those who say these things give the lie to
the Divine writings and to the Lord saying,
'Blessed are your eyes that see, and your ears
that hear,'" &amp;c. This fragment is preserved by
Stephanus Gobarus, a learned monophysite of the
sixth century.</p>

<p>"Nothing is more certain," says our author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
"than the fact that, in spite of the opportunities
for collecting information afforded him by his
travels through so many Christian communities,
for the express purpose of such inquiry, Hegesippus
<i>did not</i> find any New Testament Canon, or,
that such a rule of faith did not exist in Rome in
<small>A.D.</small> 160 and 170."</p>

<p>I ask, <i>How in the world can our author be certain
of this, when only portions of Hegesippus are extant?</i>
This applies generally to his argument that the
<i>silence</i> of the early writers is of "as much importance
as their supposed allusions to the Gospels."
Such a mode of reasoning is aptly commented
upon by the Rev. Kentish Bache, in his letter to
Dr. Davidson on the Fourth Gospel. He says:
"When but small portions of a work have been
preserved to our use, it is no wonder that these
portions should make no mention of many circumstances
interesting and important, which the
writer must certainly have known and told of.
If I tear a few leaves from the middle of my
English History book, I shall find on <i>them</i> (the
few leaves) no record of the Norman Conquest or
of the Battle of Waterloo. Would it thence be a
fair conclusion that these events are unhistorical
and fictitious?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Papias is next referred to. He was Bishop of
Hierapolis, in Phrygia, in the first half of the second
century, and is said to have suffered martyrdom
under Marcus Aurelius, about <small>A.D.</small> 160-167.
About the middle of the second century he wrote a
work in five books, called, "Exposition of the Lord's
Oracles," which is lost, excepting a few fragments
preserved by Eusebius and Irenæus. We have the
preface to his book, which states: "I shall not
hesitate to set beside my interpretations all that I
rightly learnt from the Presbyters, and rightly remembered,
earnestly testifying to its truth. For
I have not, like the multitude, delighted in those
who spoke much, but in those who taught the
truth; nor in those who recorded alien commandments,
but in those who recall those delivered by
the Lord to faith, and which come from truth itself.
If it happened that any one came who had
followed the Presbyters, I inquired minutely after
the words of the Presbyters&mdash;what Andrew or
what Peter said, or what Philip or what Thomas
or James, or what John or Matthew, or what any
other of the disciples of the Lord, and what
Aristion and the Presbyter John, the disciples of
the Lord, say; for I held that what was to be
derived from books was not so profitable as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
from the living and abiding voice." "It is clear
(says our author) from this that even if Papias
knew any of our Gospels, he attached little or
no value to them, and that he knew absolutely
nothing of the Canonical Scriptures of the New
Testament" (p. 445).</p>

<p>I remark that it is far from clear that he
attached no value to our Gospels from anything
he says in the fragments extant, and of course we
know nothing of those portions that are lost. We
know that he was making a book, consisting of
what he could gather from tradition about "the
truth," "to set beside his interpretations" about
the "commandments delivered by the Lord to
faith." There were Gospel writings in circulation,
and he was supplementing what they recorded.
There is positively no evidence to make us think
that our present Gospels were unknown to him.
He does not, in the fragments we have, mention
Paul's writings, nor the Gospel of Luke, nor the
Fourth Gospel, but he does allude to a book by
Matthew and another by Mark, and Eusebius tells
us that Papias makes use of passages taken from
Peter's first epistle and John's first epistle. So,
on the whole, the testimony of Papias, instead of
being against is in favour of the Synoptics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
also of the Fourth Gospel; for the silence inference
applies no more to it than it does to Paul and
Luke's writings, and the statement of Eusebius
about John's Epistle is not to be set aside, for if
John wrote it, it will be allowed he wrote the
Gospel. His evidence respecting Mark is important,
for the fragments contain a statement that
"Mark recorded what fell from Peter, writing
accurately, and taking especial care neither to
omit nor to misrepresent anything;" and Papias
says that "Peter preached with a view to the
benefit of his hearers, and not to give a history of
Christ's discourses." Our author's inference is
that it is some other person of the name of Mark
that is connected with the Second Gospel, and not
the Mark that Papias refers to. This is very far-fetched
and improbable, for the description tallies
well with our Second Gospel, and quite admits of
the supposition that Mark had every opportunity
of obtaining from eye-witnesses the historical
materials of his Gospel. No one supposes that
every statement in the book emanated from
Peter's discourses.</p>

<p>Papias is the only early writer that our author
acknowledges furnishes any evidence in favour of
the Synoptic Gospels. He cannot deny that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
records that Matthew composed discourses of the
Lord in the Hebrew tongue, but he says "<i>that
totally excludes the claim of our Greek Gospel to apostolic
origin</i>." The boldness of this assertion can
only be properly met by an equally explicit denial
that it does anything of the kind. If the translation
be a faithful one from a Hebrew version,
it is of course entitled to the epithet apostolic if
the original possessed it. Our author must have
some peculiar notions about verbal inspiration if
this be the rule he lays down. But he altogether
overlooks the supposition that Matthew's Gospel
was not originally written in Hebrew, notwithstanding
this statement of Papias.</p>

<p>Tischendorf, in his book issued by the Tract Society,
entitled, "When were our Gospels Written?"
maintains that the assertion of Papias "rests on
a misunderstanding," and he briefly states his
reasons for this view. He says: "This Hebrew
text must have been lost very early, for not one
even of the very oldest Church fathers had ever
seen or used it." "There were two parties among
the Judaisers&mdash;the one the Nazarenes and the
other the Ebionites. Each of these parties used
a gospel according to Matthew, the one party
using a Greek and the other party a Hebrew text.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
That they did not scruple to tamper with the text,
to suit their creed, is probable from their very
sectarian spirit. The text, as we have certain
means of proving, rested upon our received text
of Matthew, with, however, occasional departures,
to suit their arbitrary views. When then it was
reported, in later times, that these Nazarenes, who
were one of the earliest Christian sects, possessed
a Hebrew version of Matthew, what was more
natural than that some person or other, thus falling
in with the pretensions of this sect, should say
that Matthew was originally written in Hebrew,
and that the Greek was only a version from it?
How far these two texts differed from each other
no one cared to inquire; and with such separatists
who withdrew themselves to the shores of the
Dead Sea, it would not have been easy to have
attempted it."</p>

<p>"Jerome, who knew Hebrew, as other Latin
and Greek fathers did not, obtained in the fourth
century a copy of this Hebrew Gospel of the
Nazarenes, and at once asserted that he had
found the original. But when he looked more
closely into the matter, he confined himself to
the statement that many supposed this Hebrew
text was the original of Matthew's Gospel. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
translated it into Latin and Greek, and added
a few observations of his own on it. From these
observations of Jerome, as well as from other
fragments, we must conclude that this notion of
Papias cannot be substantiated; but, on the contrary,
this Hebrew has been drawn from the Greek
text, and disfigured moreover here and there with
certain arbitrary changes. The same is applicable
to a Greek text of the Hebrew Gospel in use among
the Ebionites. This text, from the fact that it
was in Greek, was better known to the Church
than the Hebrew version of the Nazarenes; but
it was always regarded, from the earliest times,
as only another text of Matthew's Gospel."</p>

<p>The references to Justin Martyr occupy nearly
one hundred and fifty pages of the work. He was
one of the most learned and one of the earliest
writers of the Church not long after the apostles.
His conversion took place about the year 132, and
his martyrdom, <small>A.D.</small> 165.</p>

<p>In his second "Apology," <small>A.D.</small> 139, and in his
Dialogue with Tryphon the Jew, are many quotations
of passages found in the Gospels. He quotes
from all the four Evangelists, and our author's elaborate
attempt to prove the contrary is certainly
not successful. His objection, based on slight discrepancies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in the words while the sense is identical,
is frivolous in the extreme. Supposing there
were in Justin's hands a primitive work which
supplied the passages, and that work was embodied
in the canonical compilation, they can be
truthfully said to be quotations from the latter.
The objection to his quotations on the grounds
that they are not verbatim, is neutralized by the
fact that neither are his quotations from the Old
Testament always exact.</p>

<p>It has been shown that "if Justin did not quote
from our Gospels, there must have been in his
hands, in the second century, a variety of accounts
of Christ's life, to which he, a leading
Christian apologist, attached the greatest importance;
and yet, in the course of the few
following years, those accounts must have disappeared,
and four others, of which this eminent
Christian apologist knew nothing, must have
taken their place. This would have been what
Canon Westcott justly calls a 'revolution,' for it
would have, in a single generation, entirely
changed the records of the life of Christ publicly
used by the Christians."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Justin quotes from a book entitled the "Memoirs,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
which he says "are called Gospels," and
our author tries to make out that the passage
quoted is an interpolation. It is not the only
instance where the "wish," and not the proof,
"is father to the thought."</p>

<p>In Justin's work, the "Apology," occur the
words, "And thou shalt call his name Jesus,
for he shall save his people from their sins;"
which are found in the apocryphal Gospel of
James, as said to the Virgin Mary, while in
Matthew's Gospel they are spoken to Joseph.
It is urged that Justin must, therefore, have
quoted them from a lost Gospel; but why should
it be supposed so when they are in the apocryphal
Gospel of James, which, Origen says, was everywhere
known about the end of the second century,
and which, there is good ground for believing,
was written in the early part of that century?</p>

<p>A few other passages in Justin's work, which
are not found in our Gospels, may be accounted
for by supposing them to be quotations either
from lost Gospels, genuine or apocryphal, or tradition
may have supplied them. There is no certain
inference to be arrived at.</p>

<p>Justin tells us in his first "Apology" (<small>A.D.</small> 139),
that the memoirs of the apostles called evangels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
were read <i>after the prophets</i> every <i>Lord's Day</i> in
the assemblies of the Christians.</p>

<p>This must have reference to the writings which
alone, a few years later, were universally known
as the Four Gospels, or the Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<p>The second volume of the work opens with an
examination of "the evidence furnished by the
apocryphal religious romance generally known by
the name of 'The Clementines,'" which includes
the Homilies, the Recognitions, and a so-called
Epitome&mdash;the Homilies and Recognitions being,
he says, "the one merely a version of the other,"
and the Epitome a blending of the other two.
As there are in the Clementine Homilies upwards
of a hundred quotations of expressions of Jesus,
or references to His history (not less than fifty
passages from the Sermon on the Mount), it is
important to ascertain, if possible, when they
were written, and from what writings they quote.
The date cannot be determined. The range of
probability is from the middle of the second
century. If much later, the inquiry does not
amount to much, because we know, from ample
evidence, such as that of Irenæus, that the Four
Gospels as we have them were in existence, and
read in the Churches, in the middle of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
century. We presume, therefore, our author takes
an early date for granted, or he would not have
occupied forty pages in their examination.</p>

<p>The first quotation which, he says, agrees with
a passage in our Synoptics, occurs in the third
Homily, p. 52: "And he cried, saying, Come
unto me all ye that are weary;" which agrees
with Matt. xi. 28. Because the quotation is not
continued, but the following words are an explanation
of what "Come unto me," &amp;c., means&mdash;"that
is, who are seeking truth, and not finding
it,"&mdash;we are to deem it "evident that so short and
fragmentary a phrase cannot prove anything."
I exclaim, Indeed! Not in a book that contains
a hundred references to the words of Jesus!
Not, considering that they are especially the
words of Jesus, that no one else so said to the
weary, "Come unto me!" Most readers will
surely think the contrary should be inferred!</p>

<p>Among the quotations are words resembling
the text of Matthew xxv. 26-30: "Thou wicked
and slothful servant: thou oughtest to have put
out my money with the exchangers, and at my
coming I should have exacted mine own."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> If
this were the only reference to the Gospels as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have them, the quotation is sufficiently near to
make the inference certain that such writings, in
some shape, must have been in existence when
the Clementine Homilies were written. This our
author acknowledges, but he says (vol. ii. p. 17):
"If the variations were the exception among a
mass of quotations perfectly agreeing with the
parallels in our Gospels, it might be exaggeration
to base upon such divergences a conclusion that
they were derived from a different source. The
variations being the rule, instead of the exception,
these, <i>however slight</i>, become evidence of the
use of a different Gospel from ours."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>I remark, supposing this be so, that the author
of these Homilies had, in the year 160, other
Gospel manuscripts before him, it is not pretended
that our Gospels contain all that was known of
the sayings of Jesus, and all the events of His
public ministry. We are told in the Fourth
Gospel: "There are also many other things which
Jesus did, the which, if they should be written
every one, I suppose that even the world itself
could not contain the books that should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
written."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> If the author of the Fourth Gospel did
not include many things which he knew had been
previously written about, why should we be surprised
to find the authors of the Synoptic Gospels
record only portions?</p>

<p>We know that Paul wrote an epistle to the
Church at Laodicea, which is not preserved to us.
We hold that Paul was as much an inspired writer
as any of the apostles, and instead of making all
sorts of difficulties about the books we have,
we ought to be grateful that they are extant. We
read in Paul's Epistle to the Colossians, iv. 16:
"And when this epistle is read among you, cause
that it be read also in the Church of the Laodiceans;
and that ye likewise read the epistle from
Laodicea."</p>

<p>I wonder whether our author has an objection
to the genuineness of the Epistle to the Colossians,
because Epictetus, who was born at Hierapolis
about <small>A.D.</small> 50, which was within a few miles
of Colosse and Laodicea, and who would be likely
to know, at that time, what was there going on,
does not refer to Paul and the Churches there?</p>

<p>But it is useless to disprove the assertion that
there are no quotations from the Gospels, for we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
are met at every turn with the objection that
those specified are probably quotations from the
numerous lost Gospels known to have been in
circulation. He says: "The great mass of intelligent
critics are agreed that our Synoptics have
assumed their present form only after repeated
modifications by various editors of earlier evangelical
works. The primitive Gospels have entirely
disappeared, supplanted by the later and
more amplified versions (p. 459). The first two
Synoptics bear no author's name, because they
are not the work of any one man, but the collected
materials of many. The third only pretends to
be a compilation for private use, and the fourth
bears no simple signature, because it is neither the
work of an apostle nor of an eye-witness of the
events it records" (p. 401). I remark, if Luke's
Gospel does only pretend to be for private use,
does that affect its value? If Matthew wrote
at all, and our author acknowledges he did in
Hebrew, his work would be likely to be translated
into Greek, either by himself or some one else, and
many copies circulated. Supposing the original in
Hebrew to be lost, it is not probable the Greek
copies could be all collected from various places,
and all altered and supplemented. How could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
any one do this? He might write and issue a
new version, but he could <i>not</i> suppress the original
one unless all the existing copies were under his
own control. As we have a certain work preserved,
and no other, pretending to be Matthew's,
it is highly probable that what Matthew contributed
to the Church is that Gospel. A fictitious
one would be less likely to be preserved than a
real one, though we are asked to believe the contrary.
Our author suggests that if we had the
original writings we should find them minus the
miracles, which is altogether inconsistent with
what he has said about the prevalence of miraculous
notions among the Jews at the time. At any
rate, if the books in circulation did not relate
miracles, they would not be in harmony with the
gospel preached by Paul, and believed by the first
Christians. Supposing that there were, as Luke
intimates, and as our author asserts, many original
writings, what more likely than that Matthew
should collect some of them, and embody them,
with his own record, in one book, under his own
name? It is quite true that we meet with references
to apostolic writings under other titles than
those in the New Testament: we read of,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Gospel according to the Hebrews."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>"The Gospel according to the Egyptians."</p>

<p>"The Memoirs of the Apostles."</p>

<p>"The Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew."</p>

<p>"The Gospel of the Lord."</p>

<p>"The Discourses of Peter."</p>

<p>"The Collection of Discourses."</p>

<p>Although we do not know how these were
embodied in our New Testament Scriptures, it is
probable that they were in some way included,
or the copies of the present Gospels may not all
have uniformly borne the same titles as we know
them by. In our day it is not usual for an author's
name to appear in the body of his work, and often
a title-page gives more than one title.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> How
few persons can give the exact title of the book
known as "Butler's Analogy." The value of a
book does not depend essentially upon the person
who wrote it. We do not know who wrote
the Book of Job, many of the Psalms, the
Epistle to the Hebrews, and other portions of
the Bible, but it would be unwise to reject their
teaching on that account.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>Our author says: "No reason whatever has
been shown for accepting the testimony of these
Gospels as sufficient to establish the reality of
miracles" (p. 249). I remark, the question is,
Do they show such <i>in</i>sufficient testimony as to
warrant the conclusion that the general evidence
based on a great variety of proofs is not to be
accepted?</p>

<p>The Epistle to Diognetus is a short composition,
which has been ascribed to Justin Martyr,
but its authorship is uncertain, and the date of
its composition. It is not quoted or mentioned by
any ancient writer. The two concluding chapters
are supposed to have been written by a different
hand. To the first quarter of the second half to the
end of that century the date is variously assigned.
It is written in pure Greek, and is elegant in style.
Bunsen, in his valuable book, "Hippolytus and
his Age," asserts that "the epistle is certainly
the work of a contemporary of Justin the Martyr;"
that he believes he has proved that the first part
is a portion of the lost early Letter of Marcion, of
which Tertullian speaks; and that "the very
beautiful and justly admired second fragment,
which in our editions of Justin's works is given
at the end of that Patristic gem, the Epistle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Diognetus,"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> does not belong to that letter, but
is the conclusion of the great work, in ten books,
by Hippolytus, "The Refutation of all Heresies."
Our author, in the eighteen pages devoted to
the Epistle to Diognetus, says nothing of this,
although it is both important and interesting. He
says the supposed allusions in the Fourth Gospel
may be all referable to Paul's epistles, that the
date and author are unknown, and that the letter
is of no evidential value. His two brief allusions
to Bunsen's work show that the ignoring of that
eminent man's opinion was not unintentional;
while the absence of any reference to Bunsen's
elaborate proof that Hippolytus wrote the "Refutation,"
is also significant.</p>

<p>Our author says of Basilides, "He was founder
of a system of Gnosticism, who lived at Alexandria
about the year 125. With the exception of
a very few brief fragments, none of his writings
have been preserved, and all our information
regarding them is derived from writers opposed
to him. Eusebius states that Agrippa Castor,
who had written a refutation of the doctrines of
Basilides, 'Says that he had composed twenty-four
books upon the gospel.' This is interpreted
by Tischendorf to imply that the work was a
commentary upon our four Gospels, a conclusion
the audacity of which can scarcely be exceeded"
(p. 42). I remark that by "the gospel" would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
be meant the gospel which was preached by the
apostles, and Tischendorf is not far wrong in
supposing that the written records of it in the
hands of the first Christians was the subject of
the commentary. Our author has certainly not
proved the contrary. He says: "We know that
Basilides made use of a Gospel, written by himself
it is said, but certainly called after his own name;
... but the fragments of that work which are
extant are of a character which precludes the
possibility of the work being considered a Gospel."
Neander affirmed the Gospel of Basilides to be
the Gospel according to the Hebrews. I remark
that that is not only probable, but that the Gospel
to the Hebrews may have been the Hebrew
translation of the Greek Gospel of Matthew,
with its additions and modifications, to suit the
Jewish Nazarene sect, who, we know, had a
Hebrew text of their own, which they did not
hesitate to alter and adapt to their own views.
Basilides, says our author, expressly states that
he received his knowledge of the truth from
Glaucis, the "interpreter of Peter," whose disciple
he claimed to be. Basilides also claimed to have
received from a certain Matthias the report of
private discourses which he had heard from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Saviour for his special instruction. Canon Westcott
writes: "Since Basilides lived on the verge
of the apostolic times, it is not surprising that
he made use of other sources of Christian doctrine
besides the canonical books. The belief
in Divine inspiration was still fresh and real."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Our author says: "It is apparent, however,
that Basilides, in basing his doctrine on these
apocryphal books as inspired, and upon tradition,
and in having a special Gospel called after his
own name, ignores the canonical Gospels, offers
no evidence for their existence, but proves that
he did not recognise any such works as of authority."
I remark, the question is not their
authority, but, Did they exist? Basilides wrote
a book, called it a Gospel, or commentary of
the Gospel, and made as much use as suited
his heretical purpose of the canonical records,
of tradition, and of other books. This seems
to be what we can arrive at. Hippolytus,
writing of the Basilideans and describing their
doctrines, uses the singular pronoun "he"&mdash;"he
says," in a passage of which our author gives an
unintelligible translation. This pronoun is an
inconvenient witness. Our author wants it to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
"they," in order that the disciples of Basilides
living at a later period, when the Gospels were
generally recognised, may be meant, and not
Basilides, who lived <small>A.D.</small> 125. Hippolytus has a
sentence of Basilides, which our author translates
as follows:&mdash;"Jesus, however, was generated
according to <i>these</i>, as we have already said. But
when the generation which has already been declared
had taken place, all things regarding the
Saviour, according to <i>them</i>, occurred in a similar
way as they have been written in the Gospel."
This means that the things referring to the Incarnation
were as <i>written</i> in the Gospel, not as
preached, but as written; and if Basilides, as the
founder of the sect, is referred to, the statement
testifies to the existence of the Gospels in the
year 125, and the doctrine of the Incarnation
being in them. But our author says the statement
is not made in connection with Basilides, but his
followers; that it is made about <small>A.D.</small> 225, by Hippolytus,
and affords no proof that either Basilides
or his followers used the Gospels or admitted
their authority. "The exclusive use, by any one,
of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, for instance,
would be perfectly consistent with the
statement" (p. 48). "No one who considers what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is known of that Gospel, or who thinks of the
use made of it in the first half of the second
century by perfectly orthodox Fathers, before we
hear anything of our Gospels, can doubt this"
(p. 48). I remark, that those who adopt Tischendorf's
view, that Matthew was written in Greek,
and a corrupted version in Hebrew, used in
certain countries, will not have to resort to any
such explanation as our author suggests. His
examination in detail of the several quotations
is important, because it exhibits his want of
appreciation of the evidence they afford. The
first passage Tischendorf points out is found in
the "Stromata" of Clement of Alexandria, and
it is certainly from our Gospel of Matthew,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> however
that work may have been compiled (for it
is not necessary to insist that no other records
than Matthew's own are included in the book
which, we contend, was at very early date read
in the Churches, and is what we now have).
"They say the Lord answered, All men cannot
receive this saying. For there are eunuchs who
are indeed from birth, but others from necessity."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Our author says "this passage in its affinity to,
and material variation from, our First Gospel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
might be quoted as evidence for the use of the
Gospel according to the Hebrews, but it is simply
preposterous to point to it as evidence for the
use of Matthew. Apologists ... seem altogether
to ignore the history of the creation of written
Gospels, and to forget the very existence of the
&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#7985; of Luke." We value his acknowledgment,
and find no difficulty, notwithstanding the
silence of some apologists, in reconciling our
belief in the four Gospels with the facts or probabilities
of what can be ascertained as to their
"creation." We allow that the word Luke uses
(&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#7985;) refers to many, which is consistent with
the idea that many committed to writing what
they knew, and that their records were embodied
in the Synoptic Gospels.</p>

<p>The next passage referred to by Tischendorf is
one quoted by Epiphanius: "And therefore he
said, Cast not ye pearls before swine, neither give
that which is holy unto dogs."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> "It is introduced
in the section of the work of Epiphanius
directed against the Basilideans. As in dealing
with all these heresies there is continual interchange
of reference to the head and later followers,
there is no certainty who is referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in these quotations, and in this instance nothing
to indicate that the passage is ascribed to Basilides
himself. His name is mentioned in the
first line of the first chapter, but not again until
the fifth chapter" (p. 50).</p>

<p>I remark, it was the founder of the sect and
not the followers who wrote the book, and those
who opposed the heresy would, although they
alluded to the sect, have regard to the founder
when they referred to the doctrines held, and
quoted the written opinions which distinguished
the party on gospel matters. To make the matter
as plain as I can, I will suppose a case as an illustration
of the point. Supposing that in Pliny's
letter to Trajan there were found these words referring
to the Christians: "They say, the rule
which should be observed in regard to an enemy
is, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which persecute you"&mdash;would it be right
to assert that the quotation is no proof that
Christ so taught, but His disciples, long afterwards?
This is something like what our author's
objection, referring to the pronouns "he"
and "they" in Hippolytus, amounts to. "They"
does not mean "he" when thus used; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"he," when actually used in the first line of the
first chapter, and afterwards means, "they;" that
is, "He (Basilides) says," means "They (his followers
at a later date) say."</p>

<p>The plural pronoun is used, indicating the sect,
Basilides and his followers. Therefore our author
says there is uncertainty as to who he is when
used in the same sentence. He says "Hippolytus
is giving an epitome of the views of the school
with nothing more definite than a subjectless
&#966;&#951;&#963;&#7985; (he says) to indicate who is referred to.
None of the quotations which we have considered
are directly referred to Basilides himself, but they
are introduced by the utterly vague expression,
'He says' (&#966;&#951;&#963;&#7985;), without any subject accompanying
the verb."</p>

<p>The suggestion (p. 51) that Hippolytus "consciously
or unconsciously, in the course of transfer
to his pages, corrected the text," is very unsatisfactory.
An intelligent reader cannot fail to see
how an obvious inference is avoided, and how ingenuity
is taxed to make words square with foregone
conclusions.</p>

<p>Tischendorf asks: "Who is there so sapient as
to draw the line between what the master alone
says, and that which the disciples state, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the least repeating the master?" (p. 59) and
our author says, "Tischendorf solves the difficulty
by referring everything indiscriminately to the
master" (p. 59). To say that Tischendorf does
this is reckless assertion.</p>

<p>When our author has to account for such a passage
in Basilides as, "The Holy Spirit shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee," he says it <i>happens</i> to agree with
the words in Luke i. 55; and resorts to his usual
mode of avoiding the acknowledgment that such
a verbatim quotation is against his hypothesis, by
saying, "There is good reason for concluding that
the narrative to which it belongs was contained in
other Gospels." The following sentence is startling,
and apt to mislead those who do not take
the trouble to be sure of his meaning. He says
(p. 67): "Nothing, however, can be clearer than
the fact that this quotation, by whomsoever made, is
not taken from our Third Synoptic, inasmuch as
there does not exist a single MS. which contains
such a passage." What does he mean? We
turn to Luke i. 35, and read: "The Holy <i>Ghost</i>
shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy
thing which shall be born of thee shall be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the <i>Son of God</i>." Does he mean the whole passage
is not in any MS? No: he means the following,
with the slight variation at the end, is not
in any MS. "The Holy <i>Spirit</i> shall come upon
thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee, therefore the thing begotten of thee
shall be called <i>holy</i>." Only the words in italics
are different in the two passages, and the meaning
is the same, the only difference being that the
latter does not include the words "the Son of
God." The remark that the quotation <i>happens</i> to
agree with the passage in Luke i. 35, should not
be unnoticed.</p>

<p>Happens! Mark the peculiar inappropriateness
of the word. It indicates our author's whereabouts,
and is a beacon in the book to warn the
reader. Events transpire, and they <i>happen</i> to
agree with prophetic visions which plainly foretold
them! Reason being unequal to an explanation,
coincidence must be resorted to. Was it an accident
that, "at one particular point in history, and
in one special individual, the elements of a new
religious development, which, <i>per se</i>, were already
extant, should have concentrated themselves in a
new life?" This, says Baur, is "the wonder in
the history of the origin of Christianity which no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
historical reflection can further analyse." Did it
<i>happen</i> that the Messiah came as was predicted
centuries before?</p>

<p>Did Paul <i>happen</i> to have a vision just at the
time when the whole course of his life underwent
a change, and from being a chief persecutor of the
faith he became a chief apostle&mdash;no less an apostle
than the most prominent among the Twelve?
If the Saviour did not meet him on the way to
Damascus he could not be an apostle; and as he
was an honest man, and no impostor, could what
<i>happened</i> to him have been other than what he
asserted? Baur was in a great difficulty about
the matter, and said, "<i>No analysis, either psychological
or didactic, can clear up the mystery of that act
in which God revealed His Son in Paul.</i>" Jeremiah
prophesied that the Jews should return to their
own land after seventy years of exile, and they
<i>happened</i> to do so!</p>

<p>The artful way in which the evidence from the
writings of Hippolytus is disposed of is one of the
most notable things in the book we are reviewing.
The reader's attention is taxed to keep up with
the sophistical argument, and our author finds it
necessary to explain why he has been forced to go
at such a length into these questions, as to risk
"being very wearisome" to his readers (p. 73).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>These remarks apply to a great extent to the
examination of the evidence of Valentinus, described
as "another Gnostic leader, who, about the
year <small>A.D.</small> 140, came from Alexandria to Rome, and
flourished till about <small>A.D.</small> 160." "Very little remains
of the writings of this Gnostic, and we gain our
only knowledge of them from a few quotations in
the works of Clement of Alexandria, and some
doubtful fragments preserved by others" (p. 56).</p>

<p>Marcion, the son of a bishop of Pontus, became
a conspicuous heretic in the second century, and
there was a book called "Marcion's Gospel,"
which has long furnished a field for criticism.
He was a Pauline heretic, denouncing the Jewish
party which insisted upon dragging Jewish observances
into Christianity. He went to Rome
about <small>A.D.</small> 139-142, and taught there some twenty
years. His opinions were widely disseminated.
His collection of apostolic writings, which is the
oldest of which we have any trace, includes (says
our author) a single Gospel and ten Epistles of
Paul&mdash;viz., Galatians, Corinthians (2), Romans,
Thessalonians (2), Ephesians (in the superscription
of which there is, "to the Laodiceans),"
Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon.</p>

<p>The Gospel of Marcion is not extant, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
referred to by his opponents, who affirmed that
his evangelical work was an audaciously mutilated
version of Luke's Gospel. Our author gives
a brief account of the various opinions which have
prevailed about the book during the last hundred
years, and considers the discussion upon it far
from closed. Is it a mutilation of Luke, or an
independent work derived from the same source
as his, or is it a more primitive version of that
Gospel? Whence are the materials from which
the portions of the text extant are derived? Tertullian
and Epiphanius denounced Marcion's
heresy. The former called him "impious and
sacrilegious," which, our author says, implies
anything but fair and legitimate criticism. I remark,
Did he deserve the epithets? Would Paul,
who tells the Colossians to "beware lest any
man spoil them through philosophy and vain
deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments
of the world, and not after Christ," have
been less emphatic in his denunciations in such a
case? Marcion was more Pauline than Petrine,
but would Paul have failed to censure in the
strongest language such a misrepresentation of
Jehovah and the Old Testament economy as
Marcion disseminated?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Can our author's assertion be absolutely true
that "Tertullian and Epiphanius were only dogmatical,
and not in the least critical"? How
could they be otherwise than to a certain extent
critical? They were not critics in the way of
taking nothing for granted, after the modern
fashion; but they must have weighed, compared,
and tested Marcion's views while writing against
them. "The spirit of the age," he says, "was
indeed so uncritical, that not even the canonical
text could awaken it into activity." This is a
sentence which suggests that the position in the
Church of the canonical text was so evident, that
to question it was then unwarrantable, as, indeed,
it has continued to be to this day. The combined
internal and external evidences harmonising with
the believer's consciousness, his necessities, and
his aspirations, were sufficient to preclude sceptical
and captious criticism.</p>

<p>The Christian contemporaries of Irenæus, Tertullian,
and Epiphanius were uncritical in that
they did not doubt that the foundations of their
faith were sure. The gospel which had been
preached to them, which had changed the whole
course of their lives, corresponded in its main
features with the four books which were held in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
estimation by the Church at that time above all
other writings; and they would not be likely to
wrangle about the title instead of cultivating the
faith they possessed. They could not, perhaps,
prove by the rules of logic that "God is, and is
the rewarder of them that diligently seek him;"
that Christ is the brightness of the Father's glory,
and the express image of his Person; but they
knew that He had said,&mdash;"Ye believe in God
believe also in me;" "In my Father's house are
many mansions;" and, "I go to prepare a place
for you." "Be thou faithful unto death, and I
will give thee a crown of life." They lived in the
consciousness of these truths, and died (Bishop
Pothinus, for instance) a martyr's death rather
than deny them.</p>

<p>There is this remark to be made in reference to
the alleged uncritical age of the Fathers. How is
it that Marcion is seen to be so critical? He is
surely after the modern model. He who wrote the
"Antithesis," and, as our author says, anticipated
in some of his opinions those held by many in
our own time; he who wrote,&mdash;"If the God of
the Old Testament be good, prescient of the
future, and able to avert evil, why did he allow
man, made in his own image, to be deceived by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the devil, and to fall from obedience of the law
into sin and death?<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> How came the devil, the
origin of lying and deceit, to be made at all?"<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
surely he is an instance of a man in that age
possessing the critical faculty. He has the boldness
to question, and say,&mdash;"Yea, hath God
said?" "Anticipating the results of modern
criticism," says our author, "Marcion denies the
applicability to Jesus of the so-called Messianic
prophecies" (p. 106).</p>

<p>If the research which is going on as to the
Gospel of Marcion be conducted in a proper manner,
and from a proper motive, not from antipathy
to "parsons" and ecclesiastical assumptions,
which was the incentive of Strauss in attacking
Christianity, good will come of it. As Justin
Martyr did not, as far as we know, suppose the
book to be a corrupted version of the Gospel according
to Luke, Tertullian may have been mistaken,
and it may have been an independent work,
one of the many Luke refers to, the existence of
which does not necessarily invalidate the canonical
ones. We may naturally suppose that events
of such marvellous speciality and importance as
those which had "come to pass" in those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
among the Jews, would be more or less described
in letters and other writings by many persons
who were eye-witnesses. Such writings would
be collected and read when the first Christians
assembled. The difference between the four
canonical Gospels and other manuscripts would
consist in their being compiled by persons competent
to the task, who, like Ezra, were instruments
Divinely influenced to compile and "set
forth in order a declaration of those things," for
the benefit of future ages and the religious instruction
of the race.</p>

<p>The analysis of the text of Marcion by Hahn,
Ritschl, Volkmar, Helgenfeld, and others, who
have examined and systemised the data of the
Fathers, is supposed to be sufficient to awaken
in any inquirer uncertainty, and stimulate conjecture
(p. 101). I do not doubt it. German
hypercriticism is able, by a process of ratiocination,
to discredit any truth, even to persuade men
that the Throne of the universe is vacant, and
that the only altar that man has the knowledge
to rear is one to the Unknown God; but</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"He sits on no precarious throne,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor borrows leave to be."</span>
</div>

<p>They who believe in the inspiration by the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Ghost of the prophets of the Old Testament see
no difficulty in regard to the inspiration of the
writers of the New. If Isaiah and Jeremiah and
Daniel had supernatural communications made to
them, in order that the Eternal Creator might be
manifested, why not Paul and John and Matthew?
It is the foregone conclusion, on the part of critics,
that the miraculous is impossible, which embarrasses
their researches. One of John Stuart Mill's
last sentences is: "It remains a possibility that
Christ actually was what He supposed Himself
to be." If this had occurred to the great
reasoner at the outset of his career instead of
the close, how much might the world have been
advantaged!</p>

<p>Tatian is a witness whose evidence our author
next tries to set aside. He was an Assyrian by
birth, a disciple of Justin Martyr at Rome, and
afterwards, having joined the sect of the Eucratites,
a conspicuous exponent of their austere and
ascetic doctrines. The only one of his writings
extant is his Oration to the Greeks, written after
Justin's death, as it refers to that event, and it
is generally dated <small>A.D.</small> 170-175. One point contested
is Canon Westcott's affirmation that it
contains a "clear reference" to a parable recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
by Matthew:<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> "The kingdom of heaven is like
unto treasure hidden in a field, which a man
found and hid, and for his joy he goeth and selleth
all that he hath and buyeth that field." And the
supposed reference by Tatian is, "For by means
of a certain hidden treasure he has taken to himself
all that we possess, for which, while we are
digging, we are indeed covered with dust, but we
succeed in making it our fixed possession."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>There is certainly not much similarity between
the two passages, although Tatian may be well
supposed to have had the parable in his mind
when he wrote. The more important question is,
Did Tatian write "A Harmony of Four Gospels,"
which recognises our four Evangelists?
Was his Diatessaron such a book, or was it the
Gospel according to the Hebrews? If the latter,
what is the Gospel according to the Hebrews?
I say it is probable it is the corrupted Hebrew
translation of the Greek Gospel of Matthew, and
this conjecture has more in its favour than our
author's hypothesis.</p>

<p>Dionysius of Corinth, Eusebius tells us, wrote
seven epistles to various Churches, and a letter to
Chrysophora, "a most faithful sister." Only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
few short fragments exist, which are all from the
epistle to Soter, Bishop of Rome, whose date in
that pastorate is <small>A.D.</small> 168-176. In these fragments
we find the following words:&mdash;"For the
brethren having requested me to write epistles,
I write them. And the apostles of the devil have
filled these with tares, both taking away parts
and adding others, for whom the woe is destined.
It is not surprising, then, if some have recklessly
ventured to adulterate the Scriptures of the Lord,
when they have corrupted these, which are
not of such importance."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> After quoting this
passage, our author reiterates his statement
that "We have seen that there has not been
a trace of any New Testament Canon in the
writings of the Fathers before and during this age."
Does he suppose his readers will have seen as he
sees, or rather refuse to see what is plain enough?
He has his own opinion, but he need not assume
that he has convinced his readers that he has
proved what he alleges. He talks of Westcott's
boldness, and of his imagination running away
with him, and that it is simply preposterous to
suppose that this passage refers to the New
Testament. I leave Canon Westcott to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his own words, but I say it is not preposterous to
infer that when Dionysius speaks of the "Scriptures
of the Lord" he means Gospel writings,
which are included in our New Testament. If it
be assumed that the defence of the authority of
the New Testament writings and of evangelical
views is necessarily based on the synodical
authority of the early Church, there may be some
weight in his objections; but Christianity has a
position independent of ecclesiastical pretensions
to infallibility, and the latter may be overthrown
without the great institution established
by Divine mercy for the recovery of humanity
from sin and its consequences being in the slightest
degree damaged. Dr. Donaldson is quoted,
who remarks: "It is not easy to settle what this
term, 'Scriptures of the Lord,' is; but my own
opinion is that it most probably refers to the
Gospels, as containing the sayings and doings of
the Lord. It is not likely, as Lardner supposes,
that such a term would be applied to the whole of
the New Testament."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The word "Scripture," in
Greek, &#915;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#7969;&#915;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#7969; (Graphé), in Latin, <i>Scriptura</i>, has,
no doubt, a meaning which denotes an inspired
writing. It is used fifty-one times in the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Testament in the same sense, for Christ and the
authors of the New Testament regarded the Old
Testament as distinguished from all other writings,
as <i>the</i> writing&mdash;the writing of God. By speaking
of their own books as Graphai, the apostles place
them on a level with the Old Testament, and thus
assert their Divine character.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Davidson speaks of the New Testament
writings being ranked as "Holy Scripture" by
Dionysius of Corinth, <small>A.D.</small> 170.</p>

<p>Our author asserts (p. 167) that "many works
were regarded as inspired by the Fathers besides
those in our Canon," and mentions especially the
Gospel of Peter having been read at Rhossus.
He says: "The fact that Serapion, in the third
century, allowed the Gospel of Peter to be used in
the Church of Rhossus shows the consideration in
which it was held, and the incompleteness of the
canonical position of the New Testament." Now,
he ought to have quoted Serapion's own explanation,
which we have preserved by Eusebius. He
says (in his treatise written to confute what was
false in the Gospel of Peter): "We receive Peter
and the other apostles even as Christ; but the
writings falsely called by their names, we, as competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
critics, renounce, knowing that we received
not such things. For when I was with you I supposed
that all were agreed with the true faith; and,
without reading the Gospel called Peter's, which
they brought forward, I said, If this is the only
thing that seems to cause you dissension, let
it be read." Serapion says he borrowed the
book and read it, and found many things agreeable
to Christ's doctrine, but some discrepant
additions.</p>

<p>Thus the reading of the Gospel of Peter at
Rhossus cannot be instanced as a proof that other
Gospels besides the canonical ones were used
as inspired books, nor can any other be mentioned
as having been thus regarded, the Gospel
according to the Hebrews not being apocryphal,
but a part of the New Testament, whether we
take it to be, as our author supposes, the basis of
Matthew's Gospel, or, as we say, a corrupted
version of that apostle's Greek work. "To argue
that because one spurious Gospel was temporarily
received among a few persons, therefore there was
no real canon of Scripture, and we cannot be sure
that any Gospel is genuine, shows about as much
common sense and logical acumen as would be
displayed by a critic eighteen centuries hence, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
discovering in one of our newspapers an account
of the conviction of a gang of coiners, should
argue that because their base half-crowns had got
into circulation, and had passed current with some
persons who might have been expected to detect
the fraud, therefore there was no such thing as a
legal currency of intrinsic value among us; or if
there were, still we did not know or care to inquire
into the genuineness of the coin which we
accepted and passed."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Our author says (p. 16): "'The Pastor of
Hermas,' which was read in the churches, and
nearly secured a permanent place in the Canon,
was quoted as inspired by Irenæus."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The word Irenæus uses is <i>Graphé</i>, which is
sometimes translated, when found in his works,
<i>Scripture</i>, and at other times <i>writings</i>, as may best
suit the argument of a critic like Dr. Davidson,
who does so adapt the translation to suit his
purpose.</p>

<p>Whatever erroneous notions might prevail as
to apocryphal writings, the discrimination of
Serapion, in regard to the Gospel of Peter, shows
that such a work as the "Pastor of Hermas," in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which, as Mosheim says, the angels are made to
"talk more insipidly than our scavengers and
porters," would not be put on a level with the
books whose internal evidence, as well as historical
pretensions, placed them in a much
superior position. The contrast is too great for
such men as Irenæus and Tertullian, as well as
Serapion, not to have recognised the difference.
The "gross forgeries" were too gross to be at
once accepted as genuine by the Fathers of the
slight critical faculty and the ready credulity of
our author's argument.</p>

<p>Melito of Sardis, whose writings, it is generally
agreed, belong to <small>A.D.</small> 176, because the fragment
extant has a phrase indicating that Commodus
had been admitted to share the Imperial Government
with Marcus Aurelius, is the next witness.
He writes to Onesimus, "a fellow-Christian who
had urged him to make selections for him from
the Law and the Prophets concerning the Saviour
and the faith generally, and furthermore desired
to learn the accurate account of the old (Palaion)
books." "Having gone to the East," Melito says,
"and reached the spot where each thing was
preached and done, and having learned accurately
the books of the Old Testament, I have sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
list of them." Dr. Westcott excites our author's ire
because he says "that the use of the word 'old'
in this way implies that there must have been a
New Testament, and the form of language implies
a familiar recognition of its contents." This is
"truly astonishing," says our author. I remark,
it is truly astonishing that any one should assert
that the use of the adjective "old" in this sentence
does not plainly indicate the existence of other
books of a New Covenant or Testament. If the
Jewish Scriptures had been merely described as <i>old
books</i>, we could have understood the objection; but
as the words occur, "<i>having learned accurately the
books of the Old Testament</i>," we must side with Dr.
Westcott, in spite of our author's astonishment.</p>

<p>Claudius Apollinaris, Eusebius says, was Bishop
of Hierapolis, and there is the fragment of a letter
of Serapion, Bishop of Antioch, which supports
the statement, and in which Apollinaris is referred
to as the "most blessed." The date of his
writings, in consequence of an allusion to the
Thundering Legion of the army of Marcus Aurelius,
may be fixed at about <small>A.D.</small> 174. None of
them are extant. We have only two brief fragments,
in which the controversy respecting the
observance of the Christian Passover is alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to. The following passage is important: "There
are some, however, who through ignorance raise
contentions regarding these matters in a way
which should be pardoned, for ignorance must not
be pursued with accusation, but requires instruction.
And they say that the Lord, together with
His disciples, ate the lamb on the great day of unleavened
bread, and they state that Matthew says
precisely what they have understood; hence their
understanding of it is at variance with the law,
and according to them the Gospels seem to contradict
each other." Tischendorf and Westcott naturally
adduce this passage in support of the position
of the four canonical Gospels. Our author demurs,
arguing that "there is such exceedingly slight
reason for attributing these fragments to Claudius
Apollinaris, and so many strong grounds for believing
that he cannot have written them, that
they have no material value as evidence for the
antiquity of the Gospels" (p. 191).</p>

<p>Athenagoras wrote an apology, entitled "The
Embassy of Athenagoras the Athenian, a Philosopher
and a Christian, concerning Christians,
to the Emperors Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and
Lucius Aurelius Commodus, Armeniaci Surmatici,
and, above all, Philosophers;" and also a "Treatise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
on the Resurrection of the Body." A passage
from the former occurs in the work of Methodius
on the Resurrection, and is preserved by Epiphanius
and by Photius.</p>

<p>"For we have learnt not only not to render a
blow, nor to go to law with those who spoil and
plunder us; but, to those who inflict a blow on one
side, also to present the other side of the head in
return for smiting; and to those who take away
the coat, also to give besides the cloke."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Of this our author says: "No echo of the words
of Matthew has lingered in the ear of the writer,
for he employs utterly different phraseology
throughout; and <i>nothing can be more certain than
the fact</i> that there is not a linguistic trace in it
of acquaintance with our Synoptics" (p. 194).</p>

<p>The value of our author's conclusions may be
measured by what he here asserts. It seems to
me that the reverse may be asserted. (1) That
words in Matthew <i>did</i> "linger in the ear of the
writer;" (2) that he <i>does not</i> "employ utterly
different phraseology throughout;" and (3) that
many things "<i>can</i> be more certain than the
fact that there is not a linguistic trace in it of
acquaintance with our Synoptics."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>The next passage which is referred to is as
follows:&mdash;"What, then, are those precepts in
which we are instructed? I say unto you, Love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray
for them that persecute you; that ye may be sons
of your Father which is in the heavens, who
maketh his sun," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>There is also the following:&mdash;"For if ye love,
them which love you, and lend to them which lend
to you, what reward shall ye have?"<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Of this passage, our author says it is evident
that it does not agree with either of the Synoptics.
"We have seen," says he, "the persistent variation
in the quotations from the Sermon on the
Mount which occur in Justin, and there is no part
of the discourses of Jesus more certain to have
been preserved by living Christian tradition, or to
have been recorded in every form of Gospel. The
differences in these passages from our Synoptics
present the same features as mark the several
versions of the same discourse in our First and
Third Gospel, and indicate a distinct source"
(p. 195). I remark, every step our author takes in
this sort of criticism tends to the confirmation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
our Christian faith, which is not the Christianity
of a creed or a Church, but the belief in a Person.
The more independent accounts of His life and
discourses which can be traced, the greater the
proof of His advent and mission. The Sermon on
the Mount cannot be accounted for apart from the
superhuman. "Never man spake like this man."
The more it is quoted the more it is established
as a sublime fact in literature, which neither the
Jewish race, nor the Augustan era, nor indeed any
other race or any other age, could have originated
apart from Divine intervention.</p>

<p>The Epistle of Vienne and Lyons, written from
the Churches in those towns to their brethren in
Asia and Phrygia, about the year <small>A.D.</small> 177, giving
an account of the terrible persecution which had
broken out, is in part preserved by Eusebius. It
contains words similar to those used in regard to
Zacharias and Elisabeth, where they are said to
have "walked in all the commandments and
ordinances of God, blameless." And it has also
the words, "And himself having the Spirit more
abundantly than Zacharias," which compares with
Luke i. 67: "And his father Zacharias was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied." In reference
to these passages, our author's comment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as follows: "The state of the case is, we find a
coincidence, in a few words in connection with
Zacharias, between the Epistle and our Third Gospel;
but so far from the Gospel being in any way
indicated as their source, the words in question
are, on the contrary, in association with a reference
to events unknown to our Gospels, but which
were indubitably chronicled elsewhere. It follows
clearly, and few will venture to doubt the fact,
that the allusion in the Epistle is to a Gospel
different from ours, and not to our Third Synoptic
at all" (p. 204). The event unknown to our Gospels
is the martyrdom of Zacharias, which our
Gospels make no mention of.</p>

<p>Ptolemæus and Heracleon, two Gnostic leaders,
are next referred to. Of the former, Epiphanius
has preserved "The Epistle to Flora," addressed
to one of his disciples, which contains passages
similar to sentences found in Matthew xii. 25,
xix. 8, 6, xv. 4-8, v. 38, 39.; but our author
objects that the Epistle "was in all probability
written towards the end of the second century,
and therefore it does not come within the scope of
our inquiry;" and he goes into considerable detail
to justify this statement.</p>

<p>Celsus wrote a work entitled "True Doctrine,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
which is not extant, and of which Origen wrote
a refutation. Our author says "it refers to incidents
of Gospel history and quotes some sayings
which have parallels, with more or less of variation,
in our Gospels;" but "Celsus nowhere
mentions the name of any Christian book, unless
we except the Book of Enoch, and he accuses
Christians, not without reason, of interpolating
the Book of the Sibyl, whose authority he states
some of them acknowledged" (p. 236). He goes
into the question of the date, which he makes
out to be probably not between <small>A.D.</small> 150-160, as
Tischendorf suggests, but much later.</p>

<p>In the last fragment of early literature examined&mdash;the
Canon of Muratori&mdash;the Book of Luke is
alluded to as "<i>the third Gospel</i>," and our author
says (p. 241) "the statement regarding the Third
Gospel <i>merely</i> proves the existence of that Gospel
at the time the fragment was composed," and
that "the inference" that there was a first and
second Gospel is a <i>mere</i> conjecture. I remark that
if the statement does prove that Luke's Gospel
existed at the time the fragment was composed,
we gratefully accept the acknowledgment; and as
to the adverbs "<i>mere</i>" and "<i>merely</i>," which
qualify the noun "<i>conjecture</i>" and verb "<i>proves</i>,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
when our author's third volume appears, if it does
not furnish more than "<i>mere conjecture</i>" that the
first and second preceded it, we will allow the
adverbs properly applied, and the logic perfect.</p>

<p>The sentences in which such words as <i>certainly</i>,
<i>it is certain</i>, <i>it is undeniable</i>, <i>there is no question</i>, <i>it is
impossible to suppose</i>, <i>it is obviously mere speculation</i>,
&amp;c., are used, where the reasoning does not warrant
them, are innumerable; and it is only after
becoming familiar with the special pleading which
is characteristic of the work throughout, that the
unsophisticated reader escapes from the bewilderment
into which the evidences of Christianity
seem to get entangled. The author seems to have
got the reader into a gloomy cavern of criticism,
and it is only after the eye has become accustomed
to the partial darkness that he can make out
whether what he is taken to see are real figures,
images, or ghosts. When he has got to the
middle of the second volume, however, he begins
to see the light again, and breathe more freely.
He sees a way right through the cavern, and finds
that the figures of this underground chamber of
horrors are all phantoms.</p>

<p>The "Examiner" justly says: "For our part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
we see no reason why the Synoptic<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Gospels may
not have assumed their present form by the end of
the first century;<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and we cannot think that our
author's German oracles have succeeded in establishing
their dissimilarity from the documents
quoted by the Primitive Fathers. Justin Martyr's
references to the Sermon on the Mount, for
instance, appear to us to be actually derived
from Matthew. If, however, as is contended, they
were taken from the lost "Gospel of the Hebrews,"
this merely proves the substantial identity of the
two. The question of Justin's acquaintance with
the Fourth Gospel is more difficult. We are nevertheless
disposed to resolve it in the affirmative."</p>

<p>This is a sensible comment on our author's
general argument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3><i>THE FOURTH GOSPEL.</i></h3>


<p>The evidence that to John the Apostle is to
be ascribed the Fourth Gospel, is worthy of the
best attention we can bestow upon it. After
that apostle had been dead half a century, this
book, as is acknowledged by our author and all
other critics, occupied a prominent place among
the manuscripts of the Christians, with the name
of John, as the author, attached; and the question
now arises, after nearly eighteen centuries of
belief in its authorship and authority, is there
reasonable ground for doubting that it can be
properly attributed to the apostle who was the
companion, disciple, and bosom friend of Jesus?
I think the question may be answered with confidence
upon the evidence within our reach.</p>

<p>In the first place, Irenæus believed it was the
Gospel according to John the Apostle; and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was Irenæus, that his belief in it should be good
evidence? He was not John's contemporary,
but there was one between John and Irenæus
who was so intimate with both that the link of
evidence is fully to be relied upon, and that link
is Polycarp. Therefore, Irenæus, who was a
hearer of Polycarp, can tell us something about
it. Now Polycarp was born in the time of Nero,
so he was for thirty-two years a contemporary of
John's, and was his disciple. And Irenæus says
in a letter written to a person called Florinus,
and preserved by Eusebius: "When I was yet
a youth, I saw thee in Asia Minor, at Polycarp's
house, where thou wert distinguished at court,
and obtained the regard of the bishop. I can
more distinctly recollect things which happened
then than others more recent, for events which
happened in youth seem to grow with the mind,
and to become part of ourselves. So I can tell the
place where the blessed Polycarp used to sit and
discourse, and his going out and coming in, and
the manner of his life, and his personal appearance,
and his discourses to the people, and how
he related his intercourse <i>with John</i>, and the rest
who had seen the Lord; and how he rehearsed
their sayings, and what things there were which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he had heard from them about the Lord, and
about His <i>miracles</i>, and about His doctrine; and
how Polycarp, having learned from the eye-witnesses
of the Word of Life, narrated all things
agreeably with the Scriptures. And to these
things, by God's mercy bestowed on me at that
time, I used diligently to listen, writing the remembrance
of them, not on paper, but in my
heart; and, by God's grace, I am always meditating
affectionately upon them."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Now we may be certain that Polycarp would be
likely to know the truth of the matter, and Irenæus
declares that "<i>John, the disciple of the Lord
who leaned on the bosom of the Lord at supper</i>, wrote
the Apocalypse."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> So we have here reliable evidence
that John wrote both the Apocalypse and
the book whose author leaned on our Lord's
bosom at supper. Not only this from Polycarp.
There is extant "The Epistle of Polycarp to
the Philippians," which Irenæus believed to be
genuine, and in it we find these words: "For
whosoever doth not confess Jesus Christ hath come
in the flesh, is antichrist." I compare this with
the words in John's Epistle: "And every spirit
that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the flesh, is not of God, and this is that spirit of
antichrist." Our author says it is not a verbatim
quotation. I say it is a quotation, if not verbatim.
It is acknowledged that the author of the
First Epistle of John and the Fourth Gospel is
the same, the ideas and style being so much
alike. "The two writings," says Rénan, "present
the most complete identity of style, the same
peculiarities, the same favourite expressions."</p>

<p>It is impossible to doubt that Polycarp would
have learned from John himself whether he was
the author of a Gospel; and if Irenæus had never
heard Polycarp allude to the Gospel as John's, he
could not have believed in it as he did, and have
plainly stated that John wrote it and the Apocalypse.
There would have been in this case a
justifiable inference from "silence." If Polycarp
in his teaching had never alluded to John's
Gospel, it would have been so strange that Irenæus
would have deemed it spurious altogether,
and unworthy of the estimation with which he
regarded it; for it is one of the four Gospels that
he fancifully likens to the four corners of the earth,
the four principal winds, and the four wings of
the Seraphim. It is to be remembered that our
author acknowledges Irenæus so regarded all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the four Gospels, for he alludes (p. 91) to "the
arbitrary assumption of exclusive originality and
priority for the four Gospels" by Irenæus, Tertullian,
and Epiphanius. It is evident that this
Fourth Gospel could not have first appeared as
late as <small>A.D.</small> 150, but must have been in existence
long before; and on the testimony of Irenæus,
through Polycarp, from John himself, its authenticity
may be considered established.</p>

<p>The evidence from the work of Hippolytus, entitled,
"The Refutation of all Heresies," that
Basilides quoted from the Fourth Gospel, our
author dismisses in one paragraph (p. 371),
having fully referred to the testimony from that
writer in treating of the Synoptics. There are,
however, two very distinct passages which cannot
be objected to as quotations, and the attempt to
get rid of them by the substitution of the plural
pronoun "they" for the singular one "he," in the
text of Hippolytus, is an utter failure. The first
is from John i. 9, "The true Light which lighteth
every man that cometh into the world;" and the
words in "The Refutation," by Hippolytus, are,
"And this, he says, is that which has been stated
in the Gospels, 'He was the true Light which
lighteth every man that cometh into the world.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The other is, "Mine hour is not yet come,"
agreeing with John ii. 4. The discovery of the
work, "The Refutation of all Heresies," in the
year 1841, at Mount Athos, by the erudite
Minoides Mynas, a Greek, in the employ
of the French Government, was important as
bearing on this question, for it proves that the
Fourth Gospel was in existence thirty years
earlier than the Tübingen criticism asserted. Our
author's want of appreciation of the evidence
found in Hippolytus is one of the weakest points
in his book.</p>

<p>Is the Fourth Gospel quoted by Justin Martyr?
Our author says, No! I say, Yes! to the question.
In his Dialogue with Tryphon (p. 316)
occur the words, "I am not the Christ, but the
voice of one crying," which is evidently from
that Gospel, for we know of no other which
makes John the Baptist say the same. He says
"the evangelical work of which Justin made use
was obviously different from our Gospels, and
the evident conclusion to which any impartial
mind must arrive is, that there is not only not
the slightest ground for affirming that Justin
quoted the passage (as above) from the Fourth
Gospel, from which he so fundamentally differs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
but every reason on the contrary to believe that
he derived it from a particular Gospel, in all probability
the Gospel according to the Hebrews"
(p. 302). I remark, that the words, "I am not
the Christ, but the voice of one crying," could
not be quoted from the Gospel according to the
Hebrews if that supposed independent book did
not contain them, and there is no evidence that
it did. On the contrary, our Gospel of Matthew,
compiled, as we suppose, partly from it, would
have in that case had the words; and as it has not,
and as only John's Gospel has them, the inference
is clear that Justin had seen the latter, as well as
the other Gospel or Gospels from which the earlier
part of the sentence is taken. The whole of Justin's
sentence is as follows: "For John sat by
the Jordan and preached the baptism of repentance,
wearing only a leathern girdle and raiment
of camel's hair, and eating nothing but locusts and
wild honey." Men supposed him to be the Christ,
wherefore he cries to them, "<i>I am not Christ</i>, but
the voice of one crying (or preaching). For he
cometh who is greater than I, whose shoes I am
not meet to bear."</p>

<p>We find in the second "Apology" (p. 94) these
words: "Christ said, 'Except ye be born again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ye may not enter into the kingdom of heaven;"
and in the very same line is continued the reference
to the conversation with Nicodemus, in
these words: "But that it is impossible for
those who have been once born to enter into their
mother's womb, is plain to all." I scarce need
remind you how the statement of Christ and the
question of Nicodemus are as close together in
the Fourth Gospel. The passage there is, "Except
a man be born again, he cannot see the
kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him,
How can a man be born when he is old? Can
he enter the second time into his mother's womb
and be born?" The two sentences, coming
together in both, leaves no doubt that Justin
used the Fourth Gospel, for there is nothing like
them in any of the other Gospels.</p>

<p>It is something to have from Justin Martyr the
evidence that Jesus taught Nicodemus that a
man cannot see the kingdom of God without
being born of the Holy Ghost. If Justin quoted
from an earlier Gospel, it is against our author's
non-superhuman theory; and if from our Gospels,
it is equally so. But, supposing that he could
prove that Justin did not quote, that would <i>not</i>
prove that the books were not in existence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Paul's Epistles, 1 Thessalonians, Galatians, 1 Corinthians,
and Romans, all written not later
than the year 58, are they quoted, as we might
suppose they would be, by Justin? We know
nothing as to the extent of his library. He
might have had copies of all these Gospels and
Epistles, or none at hand to quote verbatim from.
Was there a concordance, to help a writer to be
exact, after the modern demand?</p>

<p>The internal evidence of the Fourth Gospel is,
perhaps, not so appreciable by our author as the
external, on account of his foregone conclusion
that the superhuman is incredible. But as "there
is no feasible explanation of the Divine origin of
Christianity without acknowledging the Divine
mission of Jesus," so is there no possible explanation
of the Fourth Gospel without a recognition
of the evangelical doctrine of the triune in the
Divine Nature&mdash;the threefold manifestation of
the one God. Exclude from the Fourth Gospel
the idea of the Holy Spirit having inspired John
to write it, and there naturally follows the attempt
to exclude the book from its historical and authoritative
position. It has a perfectly harmonious
place in the superhuman means by which spiritual
truth is exhibited and enforced for the benefit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
mankind, but that place is an advanced one. It
was the last of inspired utterances, and it presupposes
the development that it supplements, and
which it designs to promote. The Holy Spirit,
"the God of peace that brought again from the
dead our Lord Jesus, that Great Shepherd of the
sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,"
to make us "perfect in every good work to do
His will," must be recognised and duly honoured
if the Bible is to be understood and Christianity
successfully exhibited and defended. Let us turn
to the book. It opens with allusions to the dignity
of Christ the Messiah which no philosophy
known in Alexandria had a conception of. Philo
and his Platonic school discoursed of the Logos;
but their doctrine is distinct from that of this
Gospel. Justin takes up their idea, as our author
shows (p. 278), and draws a distinction between
the Logos and Jesus, describing Jesus Christ as
being made flesh by the power of the Logos; for
Justin says,&mdash;"Through the power of the Word,
according to the will of God the Father and Lord
of all, he was born a man of a virgin."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Philo
says,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>&mdash;"The Logos of God is above all things
in the word, and is the most ancient and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
universal of all things <i>created</i>." I do not deny
that Justin got ideas of the Logos from the Old
Testament and from the writings of Philo, as
shown by our author, but I submit that he confused
their doctrine with the more developed truth
of the New Testament. "It is certain," he says
(p. 291), "that both Justin and Philo, unlike the
prelude to the Fourth Gospel, place the Logos
in a secondary position to God the Father, indicating
a less advanced stage in the doctrine. 'He
calls the Word constantly the first-born of all
<i>created</i> beings'" (p. 292). Our author says,&mdash;"We
do not propose in this work to enter fully
into the history of the Logos doctrine" (p. 280).
Had he done so, he could not have shown
that the doctrine reached to the height of the
apostolic conception. There is no allusion to the
Divinity of the Logos, as John and Paul assert;
and no reference to the unquestionable statement
of Scripture that, in the Word made flesh,
we have a revelation of the mysterious triune
nature of Jehovah. A vague notion of it is
found in many idolatrous systems of religious
worship, and its prevalence is an indication of the
truth which tradition, from primitive revelation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
has handed down; but the mystery, as Paul says,
was hidden for ages and generations, and was
not made manifest until, in the fulness of time,
the scheme of Redemption was fully unfolded.
The gospel is called by Paul "the revelation
of the mystery, which was kept secret since the
world began, but now is made manifest by a clear
interpretation of the scriptures of the prophets,
according to the commandment of the everlasting
God, made known to all nations for the obedience
of faith."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> To concentrate the doctrine in the
Fourth Gospel and Paul's later epistles, and then
repudiate the writings, is a mode of sustaining the
denial of it which is far from being successful.
This doctrine is evidently one of the essential
elements of Christian truth. As the bread which
sustains our bodily life, so the bread of the life
of the soul, may be decomposed, but none of the
elements must be left out of it if it is to be of use.
In the Old Testament we find many passages
which show the plurality in the Divine nature.
The doctrine, it is true, was not so revealed as
to be conspicuous at the time, for if it had been, it
would have been misunderstood, and thus tended
to interfere with the schooling which the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
were undergoing to cure them of their proneness
to idolatry; but with the New Testament in our
hand we see what, without it, would be still hidden
in obscurity. As we read the Fourth Gospel in
the light of this doctrine, how it harmonises with
the "plan of salvation" which believers in all
evangelical Churches call Christianity! The book
professes to be written that men, believing in Jesus
Christ, may have eternal life; records the testimony
of John the Baptist that Jesus was the
Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the
world (i. 29); and announces the important dogma
that the supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit
is indispensable to overcome the unwillingness of
the soul of man to receive the truths of the Divine
revelation. "No man can come to me, except
the Father which hath sent me draw him"
(vi. 44). "Except a man be born of the Spirit he
cannot enter the kingdom of God." It testifies to
the Divine nature of Jesus in the most explicit
manner. "Therefore the Jews sought to kill
him," because he said "God was his Father,
making himself equal with God" (v. 18). "That
all men should honour the Son, even as they
honour the Father" (v. 23). "If ye had known me,
ye should have known my Father also" (viii. 19).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
was, I am" (viii. 58). "It is he (the Son of God)
that talketh with thee. And he (the man who had
been blind) said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped
him" (ix. 38). "I and my Father are one"
(x. 30). "For blasphemy" (we stone thee), "and
because thou, being a man, makest thyself God"
(x. 36). "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection,
and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never die. Believest
thou this?" (xi. 25, 26). "Jesus said, Now is the
Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify
him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him"
(xiii. 32). "He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father" (xiv. 9).</p>

<p>The doctrine of what we call (not having a
better word) the personality of the Holy Spirit is
clearly indicated in such passages as the following:&mdash;"I
will pray the Father, and he shall give
you another Comforter, that <i>he</i> may abide with you
for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world
cannot receive, because it seeth <i>him</i> not, neither
knoweth <i>him</i>: but ye know <i>him</i>; for <i>he</i> dwelleth
with you" (xiv. 17). "But the Comforter, the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, <i>he</i>
shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto
you" (xiv. 26). "It is expedient for you that I
go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will
not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send
<i>him</i> unto you. And when <i>he</i> is come, <i>he</i> will reprove
the world of sin, and of righteousness, and
of judgment" (xvi. 7). "When <i>he</i>, the Spirit of
truth, is come, <i>he</i> will guide you into all truth:
for <i>he</i> shall not speak of <i>himself</i>; but whatsoever
he shall hear, that shall <i>he</i> speak: and <i>he</i> will
show you things to come" (xvi. 13). The seventeenth
chapter I will not refer to in part, but
specify entire, begging the reader to meditate on
its marvellous comprehensiveness and expressiveness.</p>

<p>Much of the teaching of Jesus would be so far
above the comprehension of the disciples when
they heard it, that it would not be likely to be
impressed on their memory. The Holy Spirit
was to be sent, to bring all things to their remembrance;
and it is only by this promise being fulfilled
that we can understand the inspired words
of the Fourth Gospel.</p>

<p>Could Jesus have said what He is described in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
this book to have said, if God had not been with
Him as He never was with any other man? If
such a question be pertinent, how utterly needless
the further question, Could the book have been
written by the <i>nameless unknown some one</i> whom the
hypothesis of its non-Johannine origin substitutes
as the author?</p>

<p>Whatever difference there is between the composition
of the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalyse,
there is, at all events, a striking analogy between
the opening verses of the former and those in the
latter, where the faithful and true witness is
referred to as "the beginning of the creation of
God,"<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and as being set down with His Father
upon His throne. In the preface to each of the
addresses to the seven Churches Christ assumes
the attributes and prerogatives of the Deity.
The prominence given to the mysterious doctrine
of the Divinity of Christ is as great in the one as
the other.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular that from Rénan, who
so utterly rejects the miraculous, we should have
such a decided opinion that it is appropriately
entitled the Gospel according to John. After
saying, "I dare not be sure that the Fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Gospel has been entirely written by a Galilean
fisherman," he writes in his introduction to the
"Life of Jesus": "No one doubts that towards
the year 150, the Fourth Gospel did exist, and
was attributed to John. Explicit texts from
Justin, Athenagoras, Tatian, Theophilus of Antioch,
and Irenæus, show that from thenceforth
this Gospel mixed in every controversy, and
served as corner-stone for the development of
the faith. Irenæus is explicit. Now he came
from the school of John, and between him and
the apostle there was only Polycarp. The part
played by this Gospel in Gnosticism, and especially
in the system of Valentinus, in Montanism,
and in the quarrel of the Quartodecimans, is not
less decisive. The school of John was the most
influential in the second century, and it is only
by regarding the origin of the Gospel as coincident
with the rise of the school, that the existence
of the latter can be understood at all."</p>

<p>"The First Epistle, attributed to John, is certainly
by the same author as the Fourth Gospel.
Now this Epistle is recognised as from John by
Polycarp, Papias, and Irenæus. But it is, above
all, the perusal of the Fourth Gospel itself which
is calculated to give the impression that John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
must have written it. The author always speaks
as an eye-witness. He wishes to pass for the
Apostle John. If, then, this work is not really by
the apostle, we must admit a fraud of which the
author convicts himself. Now, although the ideas
of the time respecting literary honesty differed
essentially from ours, there is no example in the
apostolic world of a falsehood of this kind. Besides,
not only does the author wish to pass for
the apostle, but we see clearly that he writes in
the interest of this apostle."</p>

<p>As to the difference in language and style between
it and the Apocalypse, it is not altogether unusual
for an author to produce works which differ
greatly from each other. An instance is mentioned
by the Rev. Kentish Bache, in his letter
to Dr. Davidson. "William Penn, within one
and the same year (1668) wrote two different
works, entitled 'The Sandy Foundation Shaken,'
and 'Innocency with her Open Face.' The
former pamphlet is circulated by the Unitarians
as a tract demolishing the doctrine of the Trinity,
while the latter is an earnest defence of that very
doctrine; and yet Penn protests that his belief
had undergone no change" (p. 35).</p>

<p>One of the difficulties in the way of the reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of the Fourth Gospel is the raising of Lazarus
from the dead, which the Synoptics do not record.
A probable explanation is suggested by Grotius,
who says, as Lazarus was living when the Synoptics
were written, and as "the chief priests consulted
that they might put him to death, because
that by reason of him many of the Jews went away
and believed on Jesus,"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the publication of the
miracle would have exposed Lazarus to more
intense hostility, and endangered his life.</p>

<p>Our author makes the strange assertion that
"the Fourth Gospel, by whomsoever written&mdash;even
if it could be traced to the Apostle John&mdash;has
no real historical value, being at best the
glorified recollections of an old man, written
down half a century after the events recorded"
(p. 467). This bold assertion ignores the fact
that the impressions of early life are, as a rule,
indelibly fixed on the memory. Of no historical
value, though written by John! Our author
knows perfectly well that such an event as the
raising of Lazarus from the dead could never fade
from the memory of those who witnessed it. Does
he overlook, or suppress, the consideration that
John's recollection would be daily refreshed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the teaching of the principles of a gospel which
consisted of these events and discourses? We
can as well conceive of the Duke of Wellington
having forgotten, when he was eighty years old,
the campaigns of the Peninsula and the battle of
Waterloo, as John forgetting the memorable
transactions in the life of his Master with which
he was so closely identified. Besides, we do not
know that the materials for John's book had not
long before been noted down. It is not probable
that he who wrote the Apocalypse in the year 68
would put nothing into writing of the memoirs
until close upon the time when the book was
published. Such is not the mode of authorship
now, and was not then. Supposing the apostle to
have died, leaving behind him unarranged materials,
including notes and memoranda made at
various times, and that these were, with fidelity,
but with more scholarship than John possessed,
transcribed, edited, and made a book of, entitled
"The Gospel according to John," we have an
explanation of the linguistic difficulty which does
not overstep the limits of reasonable probability.</p>

<p>Well may Dr. Davidson acknowledge "it is
not easy to account for the early belief of its
Johannine origin;" and that "if a disciple of John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
wrote it, he had learned more than his master."
It <i>would</i> have been "strange if such an author
had continued unknown." If we reject the Johannine
origin, we have to believe that during the
fifty years between John's death and the time of
the book's <i>general acceptance as his</i> there lived
some one capable of writing it, of whom history
and tradition are silent. This is certainly a large
matter for sceptical credulity to swallow. How
much easier to believe that the refinement and
beauty of composition, whose charm has captivated
the world, is the work of a Grecian disciple,
who wrote under the superintendence, if not dictation,
of the apostle who only could have furnished
the materials at the time when it was written. At
the close of the first century all the other apostles
were dead, and for its authorship we cannot look
beyond the circle which surrounded Jesus at the
instituting of that ever-abiding memorial of Him,
"The Lord's Supper."</p>

<p>Among the anomalies of our author's hypothesis
we have to think of the apostles living in
the first century, and attaining their reputation
as writers during the second. In the first century
men appear, but without their writings. In the
second century the writings come to light, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
without the men. How unnatural, says Dr.
Christlieb, is this! Who can fail to see that
the hypothesis is incredible?</p>

<p>"We invariably find that an age which is fertile
in literary productions is followed by a conservative
period, in which the productions of the
foregoing period are collected and digested&mdash;first
the classical, then the post-classical. Does the
second century, in other respects, bear the impress
of a productive classical period in literature? On
the contrary, its undoubted products breathe a
spirit which bears the same relation to the New
Testament writings as does the tenour of a post-classical
age bear to that of the age preceding it.
Did these writings, especially the Fourth Gospel,
belong to 'unknown' authors, they would be
perfectly inexplicable phenomena as compared
with all the other products of that period. It has
been well said that it were no less absurd to
ascribe the most inspiriting writings of Luther to
the spiritless period of the Thirty Years' War,
than to transfer the Gospel of John to the middle
of the second century."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>"Notwithstanding their warm Christian life,
the writings of the second century evince such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
remarkable dearth of new ideas that one plainly
sees how, after the spiritual flood-tides of the first
century, the ebb had set in."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>"Compare, for instance, the clear and sober-minded
spirit of the New Testament epistles, or
the quiet sublimity of the Gospel of John, with
the epistles of Ignatius, the enthusiasm of which
degenerates into a well-nigh fanatic desire for martyrdom;
or with the Pastor of Hermas, and the
value ascribed by him to ascetic rigour; or with
the epistles by Clement of Rome, which tell the
fable of the ph&oelig;nix as a fact; or, again, with the
Epistle of Barnabas, which delights in insipid
allegories, and gives the most absurd typical interpretations
of the Old Testament, justifying
Neander's remark, that here we encounter quite
another spirit than that of an apostolic man."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Our author produces such a mass of evidence
from the early writers, confirmatory of the truths
of the Gospel, that his criticism tends to opposite
conclusions. Supposing he can prove that the
canon of Scripture is not <i>un</i>assailable, he has not
accomplished much. It is of more value to have
confirmation of the facts and principles of Divine
truth, than to be assured that the authorship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
construction, compilation, or arrangement of the
Scriptures, are just what the Church of Rome
authoritatively pronounced. Because we cannot
positively settle certain questions of little comparative
importance, are we to surrender our faith
in essentials? Are we to let the conjectures and
queries of German cavillers, with their "Yea, hath
God said," destroy our cherished faith and hope?
God forbid! It is not the preservation or infallibility
of the apostolic writings which makes His
incarnation, death, and resurrection, facts in the
history of our race. The facts make the history,
not the history the facts. Europe was saved from
Oriental despotism by Leonidas at Thermopylæ,
and the valour and patriotism of the Greeks; by
Charles Martel in the eighth century; and again
by Prince Eugene in the seventeenth century; but
it is not because history has truly or imperfectly
recorded these facts that we enjoy to this day the
great benefits resulting to civilisation from their
heroism.</p>

<p>The truth of Christianity does not, at all events,
rest on the <i>quotations of the early Fathers</i>, and our
author would have accomplished but little had he
proved that there were none found. In the first
ages of the Church, when the events were fresh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the voice of the preacher was the channel which
conveyed the saving gospel to the souls of men,
and there was not the same necessity for reference
to the written records as in after times. When a
century had elapsed after the death of Christ, then
the records of the first disciples became of importance.
They then came into prominence, and
were abundantly quoted, as our author acknowledges.
As time went on that importance increased,
and about three hundred years after the
events the Emperor Constantine ordered Eusebius
to have fifty copies of the Holy Scriptures fairly
inscribed on parchment, the use whereof he tells
Eusebius he "knew to be absolutely necessary to
the Church." Eusebius gives us the emperor's
entire letter. They were not so absolutely necessary
when most of the Fathers wrote whom our
author has referred to. <i>I</i> do not want any written
record to prove to me that the Spaniards in the
Peninsular War, seventy years ago, poisoned the
bread of the British troops. I lived in my youth
with an old Christian soldier and his wife who
were in the campaign, and used to amuse me
with their experience of such facts, as we sat
round the fire on a winter's evening. Nor of the
American War of Independence do the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the present generation depend entirely on
writings or books for the proof that it took place.
Two lives reach from date to date, and no evidence
can be stronger than such.</p>

<p>Until we have better reason than our author
has adduced for altering our estimate of these
sacred writings, so often assailed, but maintaining
serenely, century after century, their high pretensions
as a message from heaven to culture our
moral and spiritual nature, and guide us thither,
we should be foolish, oh, how foolish! to question
their authority or neglect their guidance.
Because we cannot be sure that the Bible is in
every detail the perfect transcript of Divine
revelation, we are to abandon the only solace
that humanity possesses, the only theory which
accounts for the wickedness which, without its
teaching, is such an anomaly to all else in creation,
the only bond which binds society in brotherhood,
and makes social existence capable of including
happiness here, or the hope of life hereafter.
Better a misunderstood revelation than none at
all. Better a glimpse of immortality, than the
negation which is utter darkness, and makes the
issue of existence only death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h3><i>CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE.</i></h3>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3><i>CONTEMPORARY EVIDENCE.</i></h3>


<p>We now come to the question of contemporary
evidence. Our author says the testimony of the
New Testament in favour of the miraculous is
inadequate because it is not contemporary. I
have to endeavour to show that he has himself
proved it to be contemporary.</p>

<p>The "Spectator" describes him as virtually saying:
It is as if you tried to prove some unheard-of
facts of the civil war in the time of Charles I.
by testimony not to be traced higher than the
reign of George III. I say we trace the testimony
to one of Cromwell's own officers, and our
author's own criticism shall be shown to prove
it.</p>

<p>I take one piece of evidence of his own which
he has elaborately presented. I compare it with
proofs of the same kind from other sources. I
refer to the authorities specified, and I accept it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and endorse it. But I make a different use of it.
He uses it to prove that because John, the apostle,
wrote the Apocalypse, he cannot have written the
Fourth Gospel. I use it to prove that because
John wrote the Apocalypse <i>the facts of the Gospel
are by contemporary testimony substantiated</i>; and I
contend that this evidence&mdash;clear, direct, and irrefragable&mdash;neutralises
his main argument and the
object of his book, which is to invalidate supernatural
religion and the reality of Divine revelation.</p>

<p>He says (on page 392 of his second volume):
"The external evidence that the Apostle John
wrote the Apocalypse is more ancient than that
for the authorship of any other book of the New
Testament, excepting some of the epistles of
Paul. Justin Martyr affirms in the clearest and
most positive manner the apostolic origin of the
work. He speaks to Tryphon of a certain man
whose name was John, one of the apostles of
Christ, who prophesied, by a revelation made to
him, of the Millennium and subsequent general
resurrection. The genuineness of this testimony
is not called in question by any one."</p>

<p>"As another most important point we may
mention that there is probably not another work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the New Testament the precise date of the
composition of which, within a very few weeks,
can be so positively affirmed. No result of criticism
rests upon a more secure basis, and is now
more universally accepted by all competent critics
than the fact that the Apocalypse was written
<small>A.D.</small> 68, 69. The writer distinctly and repeatedly
mentions his name. 'The revelation of Jesus
Christ ... unto his servant John. John to the
seven Churches which are in Asia;' and he states
that the work was written in the island of Patmos,
where he was 'on account of the word of God
and the testimony of Jesus'" (p. 395).</p>

<p>"It is clear that the writer counted fully upon
being generally known under the simple designation
of John; and when we consider the unmistakable
terms of authority with which he addresses
the seven Churches, it is scarcely possible
to deny that the writer either was the apostle, or,
distinctly desired to assume his personality"
(p. 397).</p>

<p>"The whole description (of the New Jerusalem)
is a mere allegory of the strongest Jewish dogmatic
character, and it is of singular value for the
purpose of identifying the author" (p. 399).</p>

<p>"There is no internal evidence whatever against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the supposition that the 'John' who announces
himself as the author of the Apocalypse was the
apostle. On the contrary, the tone of authority
adopted throughout, and evident certainty that
his identity would everywhere be recognised,
denote a position in the Church which no other
person of the name of John could possibly have
held at the time when the Apocalypse was written.
The external evidence, therefore, which indicates
that Apostle John as the author is quite in harmony
with the internal testimony of the book
itself" (p. 402).</p>

<p>I have quoted sufficient to show that our author,
whose object is to discredit the Fourth Gospel,
elaborately and successfully proves that John the
Apostle wrote the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>There is other testimony to prove this, easily
got at, besides what our author supplies.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton long ago fixed upon the year
68 as the date.</p>

<p>Dr. Davidson says: "We should despair of
proving the authenticity of any New Testament
book by the help of ancient witnesses, if that of
the Apocalypse be rejected."</p>

<p>In the present quarter's "Edinburgh Review"
(October 1874) there is a remarkable confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the importance I am attaching to the Apocalypse
as a book written by the Apostle John
during the nine months' reign of the Emperor
Galba, that is, between May 1, 68, and January
15, 69. The writer of the article, which is a
review of Rénan's "Antichrist," says: "The
arguments which support the assignment of
<small>A.D.</small> 68 as the date of its composition are
absolutely irresistible." And he adds: "Here
we have a book the date of which is positively
ascertained, and the writer almost certainly
known, while its contents are of a prophetic
character, and lay claim (in a marked manner)
to inspiration, yet are so peculiarly historical in
their character, and deal with a period of history
so perfectly well known down to its minutest
details, that it can be checked and verified at
every turn. Might we not almost say that we
have here (as in the Book of Daniel) a <i>gauge</i> by
which to measure inspiration, a <i>sample</i> by which
to understand prophecy, a <i>key</i> for a full comprehension
of what Holy Scripture is and means?"</p>

<p>The Apocalypse is, as our author describes it,
an ecstatic and dogmatic allegory. What it is
besides, which the believer in Divine inspiration
would include in the definition, is out of the range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of such a critic's comprehension, and he would
not be likely to attach much importance to the
words, "Write the things which thou hast seen,
and the things which are, and the <i>things which
shall be hereafter</i>." But he seems to have overlooked
how much essential evangelical doctrine
it expresses, and how much it is imbued with its
spirit; that it testifies to the resurrection of Christ
and the atonement. Although it <i>is</i> an allegory, its
author could no more have written it, if he had
known nothing of those doctrines, than Bunyan
could have written "The Pilgrim's Progress,"
or Milton "Paradise Lost" and "Regained."
By proving John to be the author of this "highly
dogmatic treatise," as he calls the Apocalypse, he
takes us to the essence of the dogmas. They
must have either been in existence before John
wrote it, or he invented them, for they are
certainly there.</p>

<p>He seems unconsciously to have furnished the
very contemporary evidence which such critics as
himself pretend <i>not</i> to have found, and profess
they require, before they can accept the miracles
and evangelical doctrines of the gospel.</p>

<p>He allows that Matthew was an <i>eye-witness</i>, but
denies that he wrote of <i>miracles</i>. He allows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Paul wrote of <i>miracles</i>, but he was <i>not</i> an <i>eye-witness</i>.</p>

<p>Now John both saw them and wrote of them,
for he was the son of Zebedee, and he wrote the
Apocalypse. This being proved, we have in it,
from him, as an eye-witness of the miracles of
Jesus, evidence which confirms the Gospels. The
vision is from Him "<i>who liveth and was dead;
the first begotten of the dead, who cometh with clouds</i>,"
and to one who was "<i>in the spirit on the Lord's
day</i>."</p>

<p>It as evidently presupposes the miraculous facts
of the Gospels, and is supplementary to them, as
certainly as it presupposes the prophecies of the
Old Testament, and supplements the predictions
of Daniel.</p>

<p>The allegory of "a Lamb as it had been slain,"
which is prominent in the vision, is unmistakable.
No critic could be so perverse as to deny that this
plainly indicates that Jesus Christ rose from the
dead, and that His death is referred to as a sacrifice
for sin in fulfilment of the ancient types and
sacrificial rites; nor can it be doubted that the
same is in harmony with the gospel which Paul
preached and wrote about in his absolutely unquestionable
epistles, to which alone we refer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
avoiding, for obvious reasons, allusion to the
Acts of the Apostles, as our author seems to
ignore that book altogether.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the sublime words of this Apocalypse,
proved to have been written by John the
Apostle, and as we read, imagine, if we can, that
the author himself, and the Christians of the
seven Churches of Asia and elsewhere, knew
nothing of the miraculous facts of the Gospels
and the doctrine of the atonement with which
they are inseparably connected; and imagine, if
we can, that they were both added, according
to our author's hypothesis, to the original and
lost Gospels a century later. It is entitled "The
Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto
him, to show unto his servants things which must
<i>shortly come to pass</i>."</p>

<p>Among such things&mdash;"shortly to come to pass"&mdash;affecting
the Church, we cannot be wrong in
understanding the attack upon Jerusalem by the
Romans to be included. If so, the saying of the
angel&mdash;"Rise and measure the temple of God,
and the altar, and them that worship therein,"
implies that Jerusalem was still standing when
the book was written. Also, among the things
shortly to come to pass, must be understood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
impending judgments on Rome (the mystical
Babylon) for the terrible and bloody persecution
which had lately happened; for Rome is evidently
referred to in the seventeenth chapter, where we
read: "Upon her forehead was a name written,
Mystery, Babylon the great; and I saw the woman
drunken with the blood of the saints and of the
martyrs of Jesus." We are left in no uncertainty as
to the interpretation of this chapter, for it is given
us in the last verse, where we are told&mdash;"And
the woman which thou sawest is that great city
which reigneth over the kings of the earth."
"The seven heads are seven mountains on which
the woman sitteth. <i>And there are seven kings, five
are fallen, and one is, and the other is</i> not yet
come." It is all but certain that the kings referred
to are&mdash;1 Augustus, 2 Tiberius, 3 Caligula,
4 Claudius, 5 Nero, and the 6th, "<i>which now is</i>,"
Galba, who reigned nine months, from 1st May,
68, till 15th January, 69; the 7th, to come next,
being Otho, who, when he cometh, must continue
a short space. It was but "a short space," for
on the 20th of April in the same year Vespasian
ascended the throne. The beast which was to
appear next is undoubtedly Nero; for though
he was dead, Tacitus tells us there was a wide-spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
rumour, which created great alarm, that
the report of his having committed suicide, when
the senate had denounced him, was false. He is
said to have been personified by a slave, who took
up his abode in an island not far from Patmos.
When we think of the Roman coins of that date
having on them the words "Nero Cæsar," the
Hebrew letters for which are identical with the
"six hundred threescore and six," the number
of the beast, which "he that hath understanding
is to count," we cannot avoid the conclusion
that Nero, under the symbol of a beast, is referred
to.</p>

<p>If this be the correct interpretation, there is
no uncertainty about the date and authorship of
the book.</p>

<p>The preface or title closes with the words,
"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear,
the words of this prophecy, and keep those things
which are written therein; for <i>the time is at hand</i>."
And then the book opens with an apostolic salutation
to the Churches, and a fervent ascription of
praise to Jehovah, and to the risen and exalted
Messiah and Redeemer.</p>

<p>"John to the seven Churches which are in Asia
(Churches planted by Paul years before): Grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which
was, and which is to come; and from Jesus Christ,
the faithful witness, the first begotten from the
dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
Unto him who loved us, and washed us from our
sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings
and priests unto God and his Father; to him be
glory and dominion for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"I John, who also am your brother, and companion
in tribulation, and in the kingdom and
patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is
called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the
testimony of Jesus Christ." "I was in the spirit
on the Lord's day." (To be "in the spirit on the
Lord's day" is in harmony with evangelical
Christianity, and quite meaningless apart from it.
The first day of the week is, undoubtedly, called
the Lord's day, because on that day He rose from
the dead; and bread has been broken and wine
drunk on that day, in obedience to His commands,
and in remembrance of His death, ever since the
day of Pentecost.)</p>

<p>"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold,
I am alive for evermore, and have the keys
of hades and of death."</p>

<p>"The Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to
loose the seals thereof."</p>

<p>"And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the
throne ... a Lamb as it had been slain; and they
sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take
the book, and open the seals thereof: for thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and
nation."</p>

<p>"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
power, and riches," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be
unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb, for ever and ever."</p>

<p>"These are they that came out of great tribulation,
and washed their robes, and made them
white in the blood of the Lamb."</p>

<p>"And every creature which is in heaven, and on
the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in
the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be
unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb, for ever and ever."</p>

<p>There is nothing in the Fourth Gospel, nor in
any other part of Scripture, that more emphatically
proclaims the Godhead of Jesus Christ than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
this worship of Him by the whole host of heaven.
The whole creation, as twice described in the
second commandment, fall down and worship
Him. It is identical with the language Paul uses
in his letter to the Philippians: "Wherefore God
also hath highly exalted him, and given him a
name that is above every name, that in the name
of Jesus <i>every knee should bow</i>, of things in heaven,
and things in earth, and things under the earth;
and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
<i>is Lord</i>, to the glory of God the Father."</p>

<p>This sort of language pervades the whole book.
The allegory of a Lamb slain to wash away sin
by the shedding of His blood occurs a score times.</p>

<p>It is not possible to read it and believe what
our author insinuates. He wants some proof that
the four Gospels are not religious romances
written long after the events occurred which they
record. I point out that the author has the proof
in his own argument that John wrote the Apocalypse,
and that the evidence therein given to the
miracles is not affected by any uncertainty whether
the Gospels were produced by eye-witnesses, or
constructed on second-hand evidence, by such
disciples as Mark and Luke.</p>

<p>No criticism ever questions that Paul preached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
a miraculous gospel, or ever doubts the genuineness
of certain of his epistles in which the doctrines
are fully stated.</p>

<p>There are, at least, four which have never been
questioned&mdash;viz., the First of Thessalonians,
written about the year 50; the Epistle to the Galatians,
<small>A.D.</small> 52; the First of Corinthians, <small>A.D.</small> 57;
and the one to the Romans, <small>A.D.</small> 58; and in all
those letters the miracles and doctrines are referred
to which, years before, when he first went
forth to preach, were the themes of his ministry.
His insight into spiritual matters increased as he
grew older, as his later writings indicate; but
from first to last it was the same gospel.</p>

<p>He writes to the Corinthians in the year 57, to
remind them of the gospel he had preached unto
them. He says, "I delivered unto you first of all
that which I also received, how that Christ died
for our sins, according to the Scriptures, and that
he was buried, and that he rose again the third
day, according to the Scriptures; and that he was
seen of Peter, then of the twelve; after that he was
seen of five hundred brethren at once, of whom the
greater part remain unto this present, but some
are fallen asleep. After that he was seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time." Now as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Paul's written version of the gospel at this time
was in the main identical with John's, we get
from the evidence that John wrote the Apocalypse
a very definite conclusion.</p>

<p>It has been absurdly suggested by John Stuart
Mill, and others,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> that Paul originated the dogmatic
doctrines of Christianity. Now we know
that Paul, in the early years of his ministry,
communicated with James, Peter, and John,
at Jerusalem, respecting that gospel which he
was preaching among the Gentiles; for he writes
to that effect in his unquestioned epistle to
the Galatians, and tells them that when "those
three apostles, who seemed to be pillars, perceived
the grace that was given to him, they gave to him
and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship."
Would John and Peter and James have done this
if the miraculous gospel Paul told them he was
preaching was inconsistent with their own knowledge
of the circumstances and events in Christ's
life of which they were all eye-witnesses?</p>

<p>We have John writing a book before the destruction
of Jerusalem, and Paul an epistle before the
reign of Nero, and they both bear testimony to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the fact that Jesus was the Messiah of Jewish
prophecy, who descended into our world to be its
Saviour and Redeemer by the sacrifice of His life
on the cross&mdash;His miraculous resurrection from
the dead being the attestation of His atoning work,
while His promise to come again to earth in like
manner as He was seen to go away, they both
relied upon with implicit confidence.</p>

<p>As early as the year 52 Paul writes from Corinth
to the Thessalonians, reminding them "how they
turned from idols to serve the living and true God,
and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom He
raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered
us from the wrath to come;"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and he charges them
by the Lord that this epistle be read in all the
Churches in Macedonia.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Its genuineness has
never been questioned.</p>

<p>Thus it is quite certain that Paul, at the commencement
and throughout his ministry, preached
the dogmatic doctrines of the Divinity of Christ,
the resurrection, the atonement, the depravity of
human nature, justification by faith, and the work
of the Holy Spirit in renewing and sanctifying the
souls of men, which constituted the Christianity of
the first three centuries, and undoubtedly emanated&mdash;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from the depths of Paul's moral consciousness,
but from the events, Divine utterances, and
superhuman circumstances which were the theme
of the earliest Christian records.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> The Apocalypse
is absolute proof as to how they originated, and
that they were prevalent when it was written.</p>

<p>This, I contend, is sound argument, and neutralises
that of our author. Other objections of
cavillers have their appropriate answers. They
may say that the eye-witnesses might honestly
believe and teach, but were deceived. No one
would, I think, say they were dishonest, and invented
the miracles. It may be said that a single
eye-witness such as John is insufficient. But if a
jury has <i>one</i> such, and all the circumstantial evidence
in the case supports his testimony, the
verdict is easily arrived at. A tree that is grafted
usually yields fruit after the process, not before;
but we have here this tree of Christianity proved
to be fully developed in the year 68, and its fruit
described, and we are asked to believe that it was
grafted to bear its evangelical dogmas a century
afterwards! The fact is that the same apostle,
who describes its fruit in the year 68, was present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
when it was planted, and we know from his
evidence that the tree needed no grafting to
produce such fruit.</p>

<p>This evidence, from a hostile critic of such
ability and scholarship, to the authenticity and
authorship of the book of Revelation, is surely of
considerable value. As Professor Owen could,
from a single bone of a fossil animal, show what
the whole was of which the bone formed a part, so
might be used this evidence that John wrote the
Apocalypse.</p>

<p>The Christian apologist may show our author
his own argument, and pointing out the word
<i>Apocalypse</i>, exclaim, "I thank thee, Jew, for teaching
me that word!" <i>Thou art hoist with thine own
petard!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3><i>CONCLUSION.</i></h3>


<p>At the close of his work our author attempts to
console his readers for having demolished their
evangelical belief in the following eloquent language:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In surrendering its miraculous element and
its claims to supernatural origin, therefore, <i>the
religion of Jesus</i> does not lose its virtue, or the
qualities which have made it a blessing to
humanity. It sacrifices none of that elevated
character which has distinguished and raised it
above all human systems; it merely relinquishes
a claim which it has shared with all antecedent
religions, and severs its connection with ignorant
superstition. It is too divine in its morality to
require the aid of miraculous attributes. No
supernatural halo can heighten its spiritual
beauty, and no mysticism deepen its holiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
In its perfect simplicity it is sublime, and in its
profound wisdom it is eternal" (p. 489).</p>

<p>This may be eloquently expressed, but it will
not bear analysis. If "the religion of Jesus" has
an "<i>elevated character</i>," which has "<i>distinguished
and raised it above all human systems</i>," it must
have a superhuman "<i>elevated character</i>," and,
if so, a supernatural <i>character</i>, and, therefore,
the religion of Jesus is a <i>supernatural religion</i>.
To take from the Bible all that is miraculous,
and pretend it would "<i>not lose its virtue</i>,"
or "<i>the qualities which have made it a blessing to
humanity</i>," is simply absurd. The teachings of
Christ, apart from His recognition of Abraham's
faith in God having spoken to him; of Moses, as
divinely commissioned to give the law of Sinai;
and of David, to prophesy of Himself as the
Messiah, is inconceivable. It is not possible to
strike out of the Bible all that is supernatural
and leave it intelligible. What would be left, far
from being "perfect simplicity and profound and
eternal wisdom," would be, for religious instruction,
indeed, a blank.</p>

<p>Knowing what human nature is and has been in
all ages, where, we may ask, could such perfect
and sublime morality have come from apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Divine interference? As Henry Rogers says in
his recent work, "The Superhuman Origin of the
Bible inferred from itself," "<i>The Bible is not
such a book as man would have made if he could, or
could have made if he would.</i>"</p>

<p>Even John Stuart Mill, in his book just published,
describes Christ as the "pattern of perfection
for humanity;" and "a unique figure, not
more unlike all His precursors than all His followers,
even those who had the direct benefit of
His personal teaching."</p>

<p>The late Dr. Priestley, the eminent Unitarian,
said that the actual resurrection of Jesus Christ is
more authentically attested than any other fact in
history.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The fact is, in short, just this: the whole
Scripture testimony to the work of man's redemption
is, to the believer, explicit and harmonious,
while the emasculated and perverted creed of the
moralist who rejects the miraculous is sheer confusion
and absurdity.</p>

<p>We appreciate the admonition of the apostle
Paul, where he says: "Oh, Timothy, keep that
which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane
and vain babblings, and oppositions of science, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
called, which, some professing, have erred concerning
the faith."</p>

<p>It is of importance to note that the writings
which record the deaths of some of the principal
persons, such as John the Baptist, James the
Apostle, and Stephen, would, probably, have
mentioned the decease of others if they had died
before the books were composed. Supposing they
originated at a later date, the writers would have
had no motive for omitting any such particulars.
Surely, the Acts of the Apostles would have told
us of the death of Paul and Peter, Matthew and
Barnabas, and the other men whose doings it
records. If we imagine the book a fiction, then,
we ask, where are the stories which apocryphal
books contain, such as the crucifixion of Peter,
which would, certainly, have been included?
This must be accounted for before we set aside
the book as not history, but fiction.</p>

<p>This anonymous sceptical work has to encounter
the damaging objection that it enters a
verdict before the case is complete. The judge,
that is, impartial criticism holding the balance
evenly, may justly say, How can the verdict be
pronounced in the absence of witnesses of such
importance as the Acts of the Apostles and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
epistles of Paul? The final reflections at the
conclusion of the second volume are premature.
Instead of it being "right not to delay a clear
statement of what the author believes to be the
truth and its consequences," it is the opposite;
and we venture to predict that, when he has done
his worst, when he has made the most of the
silence of primitive writers whose works time
has reduced to fragments; when he has fully
exposed the irrelevancy of many of the assertions
of over-sanguine apologists (such as Tischendorf
and Canon Westcott); when he has magnified to
the utmost the difficulties inseparable from the
investigation of matters eighteen centuries distant,
between which period in history and the
present time there have intervened revolutions in
nations, invasions of barbarians, cities burned,
libraries destroyed, and all that is conceivable of
obliteration, falsification, fraud, and superstition,
in what are called the dark ages&mdash;his ability,
learning, research, and logic will not have convinced
the majority of his readers that Christianity
is to be placed in the category of the
world's religious delusions and impostures. His
complete work will be fully replied to by critics
of his own calibre and acumen, and the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
honour it will ultimately attain will be to be relegated
to the unenviable position in literature in
which are placed Spinoza, Hume, Baur, Strauss,
Rénan, Mill, and all those able doubters who have
boldly but unsuccessfully assailed the truth as it
is in Jesus.</p>

<p>I close with the remark that the Bible is regarded
by the Evangelical Protestant Nonconformists
from an independent point of view. The
authority of the councils of the Popish Church is
nothing to them. The decision of the Council of
Laodicea, <small>A.D.</small> 364, furnishes evidence of the Holy
Scriptures being, in the main, what we esteem them
to be; but we do not recognise its authority.</p>

<p>We are in a position to welcome any light
which any critic can throw upon the records of
Divine revelation, and can be grateful for any
laborious research which separates the gold from
the dross, and selects the real coin from the
counterfeit. But it is undoubtedly true that, as
the religion of the Bible is a spiritual matter, it
is best discerned by those whose hearts are open
to receive it.</p>

<p>"If any man will do his will, he shall know
of the doctrine whether it be of God."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that believeth on the Son of God hath the
witness in himself."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> "Filled with the knowledge
of his will in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>On the assumption that man is not a spiritual
being, the investigation of what the Bible teaches
is not likely to be successful. The most prominent
statements will be foolishness. The primary
fact that God is a Spirit will not be apprehended,
and all analogous doctrines deemed the outgrowth
of superstition. It is the vainest of all inquiries
from such a foregone conclusion. Man is not
placed at such a point of observation in the
universe as to be competent to conduct a theological
investigation, based on a negative hypothesis,
regarding the essential proposition of all
religious truth. Among the indispensable requisites
in the pursuit of such knowledge, are, the
receptive disposition, the listening attitude, the
becoming humility, the consciousness of a tendency
to go wrong, and of dependence on the Divine
illumination of the Holy Spirit. "Blind unbelief
is sure to err." The inquirer who does not lay
aside pride and self-sufficiency is not in a condition
to take the first step. If intellectual power,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
acuteness of perception, and the logical faculty,
could ensure the successful pursuit of spiritual
truth, we may suppose that Satan's knowledge
would convince him of the folly of his opposition
to the Divine authority. That which intervenes
betwixt the Almighty Creator and the fallen
angel intercepts the vision of the depraved human
soul. Only "the pure in heart can see God."
The blindness is not removable until, as in the
case of Saul of Tarsus, those conditions are complied
with which are implied in the statement,
"Behold he prayeth." His soul is humbled, his
eyes are opened, and he gets nearer to the truth.
"The Lord is nigh unto them who call upon
him."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>
The summary of what I have endeavoured to
make plain to you respecting the book is briefly
this:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That it chiefly consists of German scepticism
made plain to English readers; of a recast of
the exploded fallacies of Hume; and an unsuccessful
attempt to eliminate the miraculous from
the Gospels.</p>

<p>2. That the assumption that there are in the
Bible Satanic miracles, thus putting Jewish superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
on a level with revealed truth, is reasoning
on false premises.</p>

<p>3. That the miracles of the Bible do not admit
of their being accommodated to the laws of
nature, to satisfy the scientific and philosophical
theologians.</p>

<p>4. That the objection to the testimony of the
first disciples, on the ground of their not being
learned, scientific, and critical, has no weight,
especially as applied to Paul, whose education
would enable him to weigh the evidence of the
eye-witnesses, which he would compare with
the revelation to himself; and thus he was in a
position to know the exact truth.</p>

<p>5. That the abstract argument against miracles
not having sufficient force to merit Mr. Arnold's
endorsement, its further discussion was not
necessary, the first part of the book being sufficiently
neutralised.</p>

<p>6. That the argument from the silence of early
Church writers is not conclusive, because we have
only fragments of their writings, and that there
was not the same need to refer to written records
while tradition was fresh.</p>

<p>7. That the objection to a quotation because it
is not verbatim is frivolous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>8. That the hypothesis that the original records
of Christ's life, which are not our Gospels, and are
lost, did not contain any miracles, is a German
conjecture, which is totally unsupported and absolutely
incredible.</p>

<p>9. That the assumption of uniform and verbal
inspiration is not an essential of orthodox views,
and that Christianity has been more damaged by
its friends than its enemies.</p>

<p>10. That the author's mode of presenting his
facts is not to be relied upon, any more than his
conclusions.</p>

<p>11. That offensive epithets and unwarrantable
boldness of assertion do not strengthen his arguments;
nor is eloquent language always sense.</p>

<p>12. That the question is not whether the Gospels
establish the reality of miracles, so that
Christianity is false if they do not sufficiently do
so; but is the general evidence, resting on a great
variety of proofs, sufficient to prove it true?</p>

<p>13. That special pleading is found throughout
the book.</p>

<p>14. That whatever information is wanting, as
to the exact manner in which the four Gospels
were compiled&mdash;whatever probability there may be
that Matthew's is made up of materials from several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
other sources, such as the lost "Gospel of the
Hebrews," as well as from that apostle's own
record of what he heard and was eye-witness of&mdash;whatever
probability there may be that the Fourth
Gospel is only the Apostle John's to the extent of
his having furnished the materials, which Grecian,
rather than Jewish, pens put into elegant language
and artistic form&mdash;it is undeniable that if John
the son of Zebedee, the apostle, wrote the Apocalypse,
as our author proves he did, the fact furnishes
the strongest evidence, "clear, direct, and
irrefragable," that he knew, being an eye-witness
of the events of the Gospel records, the Resurrection
of Christ to be no "cunningly devised
fable," but the fact of facts, the truth of truths,
the miracle of miracles.</p>

<p>15. That the religion of the Bible being spiritual,
its truths are best discerned by those whose
hearts are open to receive them.</p>

<p>The vast expanse of evangelical Christian evidence,
shining around us like the sky on a clear
night, has its nebulæ which only faith's telescope
can reach; but there are stars and constellations
which are so conspicuous that no inquirer
after truth can fail to see them. John to the
seven Churches, whose angels are seven stars, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
as obvious as the Pleiades; Paul and Barnabas,
as of old, are Mercurius and Jupiter; Abraham's
descendants, still distinct from all other races,
in all lands, are prominent as Sirius; Pliny's
letter to Trajan is radiant as Arcturus; the
martyr-story of the Catacombs and of history is
as demonstrative as Mars; while the institution
to show forth the Lord's death, by the breaking
of bread on the Lord's day, glows like Venus.
These, requiring no telescope,</p>
